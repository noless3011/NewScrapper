        "ARK Invest\u0027s chief futurist lists five groups that should give tech investors an edge.",
        "According to Brett Winton, robotics, artificial intelligence, multi-omics sequencing, public blockchain and energy storage are key areas because they\u0027re all entering the marketplace at the same time.",
        "\"We believe that this is a unique time in technological economic history,\" he told CNBC\u0027s \"ETF Edge\" this week.",
        "Winton collaborates with ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood to maintain the ARK Venture Fund (ARKVX), which allows investors to buy into the private technology space.",
        "According to the firm\u0027s website, the goal of the fund is to make venture capital offerings of innovative spaces in the market accessible to individual investors. As of April 10, it shows the fund\u0027s top holdings include Epic Games, known for online video game Fortnite, and biotech companies Freenome and Relation Therapeutics.",
        "\"Our emphasis is that we are investing in innovation over the long term and going to support management teams,\" said Winton.",
        "He contends it\u0027s a strategy that\u0027s often not prioritized.",

        "Sanctioned entities, like those linked to North Korean hacking groups and U.S.-designated terrorist organizations such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, continue to rely on cryptocurrency for fundraising, according to a new report from Chainalysis.",
        "The American blockchain analysis firm’s “2024 Crypto Crime Report” found that $24.2 billion of illicit cryptocurrency was transferred in 2023, based on already identified illicit crypto wallets. Chainalysis retroactively updates its yearly crypto figures when new illicit wallets come to light.",
        "While last year’s numbers currently represent a drop from the previous year, Chainalysis noted a much higher proportion of the funds were attributed to sanctioned or terrorist-linked recipients, accounting for about 61.5% of total illicit transaction volume in 2023.",
        "“Actors subject to sanctions are often cut off from international traditional financial systems, and crypto can become an attempted alternative mechanism to store, send, and receive funds,” Andrew Fierman, head of sanctions strategy at Chainalysis, told CNBC on Thursday.",
        "Entities like the crypto “mixer” Tornado Cash and Garantex took the lion’s share of illicit funds in 2023. Tornado Cash was sanctioned in August 2022 for its role in laundering crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus Group. Russian-based exchange Garantex was sanctioned in April 2022 for its affiliation with illicit actors, including ransomware groups.",
        "Crypto mixers are software that obscure the history and origin of digital assets sent through them.",
        "The amount of crypto transferred to sanctioned entities has climbed in recent years in tandem with a greater share of new trade restrictions specifying crypto wallets.",
        "In 2023, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions list imposed a total of 18 new sanctions on individuals and entities, including their associated crypto wallets.",
        "At least nine of the new sanctions were against individuals and entities across China and Latin America for their alleged role in fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking. Meanwhile, five of the sanctions targeted entities deemed to have violated sanctions on North Korea.",
        "The top crypto recipient added to the sanctions list last year was Sinbad.io — a bitcoin mixer that was shut down in November of 2023 — which received $665.4 million in crypto from the Lazarus Group.",
        "Still, sanctions have shown the ability to slow the flow of crypto funds to their targets. Tornado Cash’s monthly inflows dropped by as much as 93% immediately following its placement on the U.S. list, according to Chainalysis. Though the firm noted inflows slowly rebounded from that low in the following months.",
        "Of sanctioned countries, Iran was a major recipient of illicit funds, with 73.3% of inflows coming from international mainstream exchanges indicating the services might be used to subvert sanctions, Chainalysis said.",
        "Illicit crypto volume identified by Chainalysis as terrorist financing accounted for a much smaller proportion than that of transactions to sanctioned entities in 2022.",
        "Chainalysis argued that, contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrency is not an effective tool for terrorism funding because blockchain allows funds to be traced at a level of detail not typically available in traditional finance.",
        "“The transparent nature of cryptocurrency combined with blockchain analytics provides an invaluable forensic tool that empowers governments to identify, trace, and disrupt the flow of funds – something that isn’t possible with other forms of value transfer, especially cash,” said Chanalysis’s Fierman.",
        "Despite these obstacles, terrorist organizations have continued to try to utilize cryptocurrencies for fundraising, deploying intricate networks of crypto exchanges and service providers, the report said.",
        "Last year, tracing efforts resulted in the seizure of millions in funds. In one such case, Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing said in June that it had seized $1.7 million of cryptocurrency linked to Hezbollah and Iran’s Quds Force through a Syria-based financial facilitator named Tawfiq Muhammad Said Al-Law.",
        "Chainalysis’s report outlined how Al-Law’s relied on a network of legitimate mainstream exchanges and an extensive network of wallets for cryptocurrency transactions to aid Hezbollah’s cryptocurrency financing infrastructure.",
        "The wallets linked to Al-Law collectively received funds ranging from millions to over $1 billion in cryptocurrency, involving up to tens of thousands of transfers.",
        "Meanwhile, entities and individuals linked to designated terrorist groups, such as ISIS and Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, have continued to solicit cryptocurrency through crowdfunding efforts.",
        "However, according to Fierman, efforts in tracing and seizing these funds have become increasingly sophisticated.",
        "“The data also shows that as crypto adoption by illicit actors continues to grow, sanctioning bodies like OFAC are continually evolving their methods to identify these actors and disrupt their activities,” he added.",
        "In another example cited in the Chainalysis report, Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced their decision to stop accepting crypto donations last year due to the risk of potential donors being traced. This followed reports that Hamas had received large amounts of cryptocurrencies in the lead up to its attack on Israel on Oct. 7.",
        "Although terrorism financing is a “small share” of illicit crypto activity, it still presents an “ever-present concern” in the ecosystem, said Chainalysis in its report.",
        "Strengthened public and private partnerships are needed to help bolster these efforts and to decipher between illicit actors and funds sent to conflict zones for legitimate causes, it added.",

        "He’ll join the likes of Mark Esper, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense and Patrick Toomey (R-PA) on the council, which is in place to “advise Coinbase on our global strategy as we grow our reach around the world.”",
        "Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, said the company was “pleased to have George join our council at an exciting time for us in the U.K. and globally.”",
        "“George brings with him a wealth of experience in business, journalism and government. We look forward to relying on his insights and experiences as we grow Coinbase around the world,” Shirzard added.",
        "Osborne will serve in an advisory capacity at Coinbase, helping connect the company with politicians and regulators to help further the cause of forming crypto-friendly regulations.",
        "While chancellor of the exchequer, Osborne launched a slew of austerity policies aimed at reducing the budget deficit, including freezing child benefits, reducing housing benefits, and implementing a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers. He also tried to stimulate business activity by cutting corporation tax.",
        "Osborne was temporarily editor-in-chief at London’s Evening Standard newspaper after completing his tenure as Britain’s finance minister. He is currently a partner at Robey Warshaw LLP, a boutique investment bank.",
        "“There’s a huge amount of exciting innovation in finance right now,” Osborne said. “Blockchains are transforming financial markets and online transactions.”",
        "“Coinbase is at the frontier of these developments. I look forward to working with the team there as they build a new future in financial services,” Osborne continued.",
        "Suggestions of a growing relationship between Osborne and Coinbase first emerged last year, when Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong spoke onstage in a fireside moderated by Osborne at a fintech event in London.",
        "Osborne subsequently spoke with Coinbase’s chief financial officer, Alesia Haas, at a fireside chat in the Belvedere Hotel during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
        "It comes as Coinbase has made something of a land grab across Europe, expanding in multiple countries over the last few months with new licenses in place. The company was granted a virtual asset service provider license in France last month, paving the way for expansion of its services there. It has also recently secured licenses in Spain, Singapore, and Bermuda.",
        "Coinbase is currently facing a harsh regulatory crackdown in the U.S. where the Securities and Exchange Commission has accused the company of violating securities laws. Coinbase denies the allegations.",
        "Last year, Coinbase chief Armstrong appeared on stage with Osborne at the Innovate Finance Global Summit conference in London. At the event, Armstrong said he was open to investing more abroad, including relocating from the U.S. to the U.K. or elsewhere if the regulatory pressure on crypto companies continues.",
        "“I think if a number of years go by where we don’t see regulatory clarity around us ... we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world. Anything including, you know, relocating,” Armstrong told Osborne.",
        "He told CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal at the time that Coinbase was “looking at other markets” as it considers its position from a regulatory standpoint.",
        "Armstrong did later clarify in an interview with CNBC’s Dan Murphy that Coinbase had no formal plans to relocate from its U.S. headquarters in San Francisco. “Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas,” Armstrong said. “We’re always going to have a U.S. presence ... But the U.S. is a little bit behind right now.”",

Businesses have been looking to put these principles to use in other applications for blockchain, which is sometimes referred to as distributed ledger technology.",

        "SINGAPORE — There isn’t enough justification for the widespread use of central bank digital currencies right now, which makes broad adoption of such assets “difficult,” Ashok Venkateswaran, Mastercard\n’s blockchain and digital assets lead for Asia-Pacific, told CNBC.",
        "“The difficult part is adoption. So if you have CBDCs in your wallet, you should have the ability for you to spend it anywhere you want – very similar to cash today,” said Venkateswaran on the sidelines of Singapore FinTech Festival on Wednesday.",
        "A retail CBDC, which is the digital form of fiat currency issued by a central bank, caters to individuals and businesses, facilitating everyday transactions. This is different from a wholesale CBDC which is used exclusively by central banks, commercial banks and other financial institutions to settle large-value interbank transactions.",
        "The International Monetary Fund has said that CBDCs are “a safe and low-cost alternative” to cash, with approximately 60% of countries in the world exploring CBDCs. However, only 11 countries have adopted them, with an additional 53 in advanced planning stages and 46 researching the topic as of June, according to data from the Atlantic Council.",
        "“But [building infrastructure to facilitate that] takes a lot of time and effort on a part of the country to do that. But a lot of the central banks nowadays have gotten very innovative because they are working very closely with private companies like ours, to create that ecosystem,” said the Asia-Pacific lead.",
        "Even then, Venkateswaran said consumers are “so comfortable using today’s type of money” that “there isn’t enough justification to have a CBDC.”",
        "Mastercard, the second-largest card network in the U.S., said last week it has completed testing of its solution in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s e-HKD pilot program to simulate the use of a retail CBDC such as electronic Hong Kong dollars.",
        "Hong Kong’s CBDC sandbox facilitates the trial of minting, distributing and spending of e-HKD within the program.",
        "A total of 16 companies across the financial, payments and technology sectors including Mastercard participated in the pilot. Mastercard’s rival Visa also took part in the project alongside HSBC Bank\nand Hang Seng Bank\n, testing the viability of tokenized deposits in business-to-business payments.",
        "Venkateswaran cited Singapore as an example where the case for retail CBDC is not compelling enough as the city-state has a “very efficient” payments system.",
        "Last year, the IMF’s deputy managing director Bo Li named Singapore and Thailand as the countries in Asia which have made “quick progress” by connecting fast payment systems, therefore lowering transaction fees for cross-border payments.",
        "“There isn’t a reason for a retail CBDC [in Singapore] but there is a case for a wholesale CBDC for interbank settlements,” said Venkateswaran.",
        "On Thursday, Singapore’s central bank announced it will be piloting the live issuance and use of wholesale CBDCs from 2024.",
        "During the pilot, the Monetary Authority of Singapore will collaborate with domestic banks to test the use of wholesale CBDCs to facilitate domestic payments, said the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Ravi Menon.",
        "It really depends on the need of the country or what problem they are trying to solve, said Mastercard’s Venkateswaran.",
        "It won’t work “if you’re only trying to replace your existing domestic payment network,” he said.",
        "“But if it’s a country where the domestic payment network is not as robust, it may make sense to have a CBDC.”"

        "SINGAPORE — Come 2024, Singapore will pilot the live issuance and use of wholesale central bank digital currencies, said Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.",
        "“We will take our experiments a step further next year,” said Menon at Singapore FinTech Festival 2023 on Thursday, without specifying more details on the timeframe.",
        "“I’m pleased to announce that MAS will pilot the live issuance of wholesale CBDCs to instantaneously support payments across commercial banks here,” Menon said. MAS is the city-state’s central bank and financial regulator.",
        "Wholesale CBDC is a digital currency issued by a central bank, that’s used exclusively by central banks, commercial banks or other financial institutions to settle large-value interbank transactions. It’s unlike retail CBDCs which cater to individuals and businesses, facilitating everyday transactions.",
        "“Since 2016, the MAS has conducted many experiments with other central banks and the financial industry to explore the use of wholesale CBDCs on distributed ledgers to facilitate real time cross border payments and settlements,” said Menon, referring to the database spread across a network that is accessible from several geographical locations.",
        "One such pilot project is Project Ubin, which was started in 2016 to explore the use of blockchain and digital ledger technology for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities.",
        "Project Ubin was successfully completed in 2021 after five phases of experimentation. Some of the partners included Singapore’s largest bank DBS and sovereign wealth fund Temasek.",
        "MAS announced Ubin+ in November last year to advance cross-border connectivity with wholesale CBDCs through collaborations with international partners.",
        "During the pilot, Singapore’s central bank will partner with local banks to test the use of wholesale CBDCs to facilitate domestic payments, said Menon.",
        "Banks will issue tokenized bank liabilities in the form of claims in balance sheets. Retail customers can then use the tokenized bank liabilities in transactions with merchants, who will then credit these bank liabilities with their respective banks. Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital form of an asset on a blockchain.",
        "The CBDC will then be automatically transferred to the merchant as a form of payment during the transaction.",
        "“So clearing and settlement occurs in a single step on the same infrastructure, unlike the current system in which clearing and settlement take place on different systems and settlement occurs with a lag,” said Menon.",
        "On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director urged the public sector to keep preparing to deploy CBDCs and related payment platforms in the future.",
        "“We have not yet reached land. There is so much more space for innovation and so much uncertainty over use-cases,” said Kristalina Georgieva.",
        "Menon is set to retire from public service and step down as managing director of MAS on Dec. 31 since being appointed to the position in 2011. He will be succeeded by Chia Der Jiun who previously spent 18 years at MAS."
