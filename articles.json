        "Sanctioned entities, like those linked to North Korean hacking groups and U.S.-designated terrorist organizations such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, continue to rely on cryptocurrency for fundraising, according to a new report from Chainalysis.",
        "The American blockchain analysis firm’s “2024 Crypto Crime Report” found that $24.2 billion of illicit cryptocurrency was transferred in 2023, based on already identified illicit crypto wallets. Chainalysis retroactively updates its yearly crypto figures when new illicit wallets come to light.",
        "While last year’s numbers currently represent a drop from the previous year, Chainalysis noted a much higher proportion of the funds were attributed to sanctioned or terrorist-linked recipients, accounting for about 61.5% of total illicit transaction volume in 2023.",
        "“Actors subject to sanctions are often cut off from international traditional financial systems, and crypto can become an attempted alternative mechanism to store, send, and receive funds,” Andrew Fierman, head of sanctions strategy at Chainalysis, told CNBC on Thursday.",
        "Entities like the crypto “mixer” Tornado Cash and Garantex took the lion’s share of illicit funds in 2023. Tornado Cash was sanctioned in August 2022 for its role in laundering crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus Group. Russian-based exchange Garantex was sanctioned in April 2022 for its affiliation with illicit actors, including ransomware groups.",
        "Crypto mixers are software that obscure the history and origin of digital assets sent through them.",
        "The amount of crypto transferred to sanctioned entities has climbed in recent years in tandem with a greater share of new trade restrictions specifying crypto wallets.",
        "In 2023, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions list imposed a total of 18 new sanctions on individuals and entities, including their associated crypto wallets.",
        "At least nine of the new sanctions were against individuals and entities across China and Latin America for their alleged role in fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking. Meanwhile, five of the sanctions targeted entities deemed to have violated sanctions on North Korea.",
        "The top crypto recipient added to the sanctions list last year was Sinbad.io — a bitcoin mixer that was shut down in November of 2023 — which received $665.4 million in crypto from the Lazarus Group.",
        "Still, sanctions have shown the ability to slow the flow of crypto funds to their targets. Tornado Cash’s monthly inflows dropped by as much as 93% immediately following its placement on the U.S. list, according to Chainalysis. Though the firm noted inflows slowly rebounded from that low in the following months.",
        "Of sanctioned countries, Iran was a major recipient of illicit funds, with 73.3% of inflows coming from international mainstream exchanges indicating the services might be used to subvert sanctions, Chainalysis said.",
        "Illicit crypto volume identified by Chainalysis as terrorist financing accounted for a much smaller proportion than that of transactions to sanctioned entities in 2022.",
        "Chainalysis argued that, contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrency is not an effective tool for terrorism funding because blockchain allows funds to be traced at a level of detail not typically available in traditional finance.",
        "“The transparent nature of cryptocurrency combined with blockchain analytics provides an invaluable forensic tool that empowers governments to identify, trace, and disrupt the flow of funds – something that isn’t possible with other forms of value transfer, especially cash,” said Chanalysis’s Fierman.",
        "Despite these obstacles, terrorist organizations have continued to try to utilize cryptocurrencies for fundraising, deploying intricate networks of crypto exchanges and service providers, the report said.",
        "Last year, tracing efforts resulted in the seizure of millions in funds. In one such case, Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing said in June that it had seized $1.7 million of cryptocurrency linked to Hezbollah and Iran’s Quds Force through a Syria-based financial facilitator named Tawfiq Muhammad Said Al-Law.",
        "Chainalysis’s report outlined how Al-Law’s relied on a network of legitimate mainstream exchanges and an extensive network of wallets for cryptocurrency transactions to aid Hezbollah’s cryptocurrency financing infrastructure.",
        "The wallets linked to Al-Law collectively received funds ranging from millions to over $1 billion in cryptocurrency, involving up to tens of thousands of transfers.",
        "Meanwhile, entities and individuals linked to designated terrorist groups, such as ISIS and Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, have continued to solicit cryptocurrency through crowdfunding efforts.",
        "However, according to Fierman, efforts in tracing and seizing these funds have become increasingly sophisticated.",
        "“The data also shows that as crypto adoption by illicit actors continues to grow, sanctioning bodies like OFAC are continually evolving their methods to identify these actors and disrupt their activities,” he added.",
        "In another example cited in the Chainalysis report, Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced their decision to stop accepting crypto donations last year due to the risk of potential donors being traced. This followed reports that Hamas had received large amounts of cryptocurrencies in the lead up to its attack on Israel on Oct. 7.",
        "Although terrorism financing is a “small share” of illicit crypto activity, it still presents an “ever-present concern” in the ecosystem, said Chainalysis in its report.",
        "Strengthened public and private partnerships are needed to help bolster these efforts and to decipher between illicit actors and funds sent to conflict zones for legitimate causes, it added."

        "LONDON — A former British finance minister on Wednesday joined cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as a global advisor, beefing up the company’s regulatory bargaining power at a time when it faces severe scrutiny stateside.",
        "Coinbase announced that George Osborne, who served as Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer from 2010 to 2016, will join the company on its global advisory council.",
        "He’ll join the likes of Mark Esper, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense and Patrick Toomey (R-PA) on the council, which is in place to “advise Coinbase on our global strategy as we grow our reach around the world.”",
        "Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, said the company was “pleased to have George join our council at an exciting time for us in the U.K. and globally.”",
        "“George brings with him a wealth of experience in business, journalism and government. We look forward to relying on his insights and experiences as we grow Coinbase around the world,” Shirzard added.",
        "Osborne will serve in an advisory capacity at Coinbase, helping connect the company with politicians and regulators to help further the cause of forming crypto-friendly regulations.",
        "While chancellor of the exchequer, Osborne launched a slew of austerity policies aimed at reducing the budget deficit, including freezing child benefits, reducing housing benefits, and implementing a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers. He also tried to stimulate business activity by cutting corporation tax.",
        "Osborne was temporarily editor-in-chief at London’s Evening Standard newspaper after completing his tenure as Britain’s finance minister. He is currently a partner at Robey Warshaw LLP, a boutique investment bank.",
        "“There’s a huge amount of exciting innovation in finance right now,” Osborne said. “Blockchains are transforming financial markets and online transactions.”",
        "“Coinbase is at the frontier of these developments. I look forward to working with the team there as they build a new future in financial services,” Osborne continued.",
        "Suggestions of a growing relationship between Osborne and Coinbase first emerged last year, when Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong spoke onstage in a fireside moderated by Osborne at a fintech event in London.",
        "Osborne subsequently spoke with Coinbase’s chief financial officer, Alesia Haas, at a fireside chat in the Belvedere Hotel during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
        "It comes as Coinbase has made something of a land grab across Europe, expanding in multiple countries over the last few months with new licenses in place. The company was granted a virtual asset service provider license in France last month, paving the way for expansion of its services there. It has also recently secured licenses in Spain, Singapore, and Bermuda.",
        "Coinbase is currently facing a harsh regulatory crackdown in the U.S. where the Securities and Exchange Commission has accused the company of violating securities laws. Coinbase denies the allegations.",
        "Last year, Coinbase chief Armstrong appeared on stage with Osborne at the Innovate Finance Global Summit conference in London. At the event, Armstrong said he was open to investing more abroad, including relocating from the U.S. to the U.K. or elsewhere if the regulatory pressure on crypto companies continues.",
        "“I think if a number of years go by where we don’t see regulatory clarity around us ... we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world. Anything including, you know, relocating,” Armstrong told Osborne.",
        "He told CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal at the time that Coinbase was “looking at other markets” as it considers its position from a regulatory standpoint.",
        "Armstrong did later clarify in an interview with CNBC’s Dan Murphy that Coinbase had no formal plans to relocate from its U.S. headquarters in San Francisco. “Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas,” Armstrong said. “We’re always going to have a U.S. presence ... But the U.S. is a little bit behind right now.”"

This is different from a wholesale CBDC which is used exclusively by central banks, commercial banks and other financial institutions to settle large-value interbank transactions.",
        "The International Monetary Fund has said that CBDCs are “a safe and low-cost alternative” to cash, with approximately 60% of countries in the world exploring CBDCs. However, only 11 countries have adopted them, with an additional 53 in advanced planning stages and 46 researching the topic as of June, according to data from the Atlantic Council.",

But a lot of the central banks nowadays have gotten very innovative because they are working very closely with private companies like ours, to create that ecosystem,” said the Asia-Pacific lead.",

        "“Since 2016, the MAS has conducted many experiments with other central banks and the financial industry to explore the use of wholesale CBDCs on distributed ledgers to facilitate real time cross border payments and settlements,” said Menon, referring to the database spread across a network that is accessible from several geographical locations.",
        "One such pilot project is Project Ubin, which was started in 2016 to explore the use of blockchain and digital ledger technology for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities.",
        "Project Ubin was successfully completed in 2021 after five phases of experimentation. Some of the partners included Singapore’s largest bank DBS and sovereign wealth fund Temasek.",
        "MAS announced Ubin+ in November last year to advance cross-border connectivity with wholesale CBDCs through collaborations with international partners.",
        "During the pilot, Singapore’s central bank will partner with local banks to test the use of wholesale CBDCs to facilitate domestic payments, said Menon.",
        "Banks will issue tokenized bank liabilities in the form of claims in balance sheets. Retail customers can then use the tokenized bank liabilities in transactions with merchants, who will then credit these bank liabilities with their respective banks. Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital form of an asset on a blockchain.",
        "The CBDC will then be automatically transferred to the merchant as a form of payment during the transaction.",
        "“So clearing and settlement occurs in a single step on the same infrastructure, unlike the current system in which clearing and settlement take place on different systems and settlement occurs with a lag,” said Menon.",
        "On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director urged the public sector to keep preparing to deploy CBDCs and related payment platforms in the future.",
        "“We have not yet reached land. There is so much more space for innovation and so much uncertainty over use-cases,” said Kristalina Georgieva.",
        "Menon is set to retire from public service and step down as managing director of MAS on Dec. 31 since being appointed to the position in 2011. He will be succeeded by Chia Der Jiun who previously spent 18 years at MAS."

        "SINGAPORE — Central bank digital currencies have the potential to replace cash, but adoption could take time, said Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday.",
        "“CBDCs can replace cash which is costly to distribute in island economies,” she said Wednesday at the Singapore FinTech Festival. “They can offer resilience in more advanced economies. And they can improve financial inclusion where few hold bank accounts.”",
        "CBDCs are the digital form of a country’s fiat currency, which are regulated by the country’s central bank. They are powered by blockchain technology, allowing central banks to channel government payments directly to households.",
        "“CBDCs would offer a safe and low-cost alternative [to cash]. They would also offer a bridge to go between private monies and a yardstick to measure their value, just like cash today which we can withdraw from our banks,” the IMF chief said.",
        "The IMF has said that more than 100 countries are exploring CBDCs – or approximately 60% of countries in the world.",
        "“The level of global interest in CBDCs is unprecedented. Several central banks have already launched pilots or even issued a CBDC,” the IMF said in a September report.",
        "According to a 2022 survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, of the 86 central banks surveyed, 93% said they were exploring CBDCs, while 58% said they were likely to or may possibly issue a retail CBDC in either the short or medium term.",
        "But as of June, only 11 countries have adopted CBDCs, with an additional 53 in advanced planning stages and 46 researching the topic, according to data from the Atlantic Council.",
        "Referring to a 2018 speech by her predecessor Christine Lagarde, when the former IMF chief encouraged policymakers to follow the “winds of change” and explore the use of CBDCs, Georgieva said: “Five years on, I’m here to provide an update on that voyage.”",
        "“First, countries did set sail. Many are investigating CBDCs and are developing regulation to guide digital money developments,” said Georgieva referring to the speech.",
        "On Wednesday, the fund launched a CBDC handbook as a reference guide for policymakers around the world. Georgieva said many countries are investigating CBDCs and developing regulation to guide digital money developments.",
        "“Second, we have not yet reached land. There is so much more space for innovation and so much uncertainty over use-cases,” Georgieva told an audience which included industry experts, investors and journalists.",
        "“In some countries the case seems dim today, but even they should remain open to potentially deploy CBDCs tomorrow. Why?” said Georgieva. “This is not the time to turn back.”",
        "“The public sector should keep preparing to deploy CBDCs and related payment platforms in the future. Fourth, these platforms should be designed from the start to facilitate cross-border payments, including with CBDCs,” the managing director said.",
        "Countries that have issued retail CBDC include the Bahamas, Jamaica and Nigeria.",
        "Singapore’s Monetary Authority of Singapore has said that cash is “generally incompatible” with the digital economy. In a 2021 report, the country’s central bank said the demand for cash as a means of payment is set to decline further.",
        "According to the BIS, using CBDCs for cross-border payments could lower the costs of obtaining, storing and spending foreign currency, depending on design and regulations.",
        "Georgieva also said that artificial intelligence “could amplify some of the benefits of CBDCs” by providing accurate credit scoring and personalized support.",
        "Demand for generative AI has boomed following the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November last year, which was estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users within two months after launch.",
        "“It could improve financial inclusion by providing rapid, accurate credit scoring based on various data. It could provide personalized support to people with low financial literacy,” said Georgieva.",
        "“To be sure, we need to protect personal privacy and data security, and avoid embedded biases so we don’t perpetuate inequality but aim to reduce it. Managed prudently, AI could help,” she added."

        "“There will be an inflationary impact coming from [the] decarbonization of shipping … there is no question of it,” Bertrand Chen, CEO of the Global Shipping Business Network, told CNBC’s East Tech West conference in the Nansha district of Guangzhou, China.",
        "New European rules that effectively tax shipping lines for their emissions would push up costs, Chen added.",
        "“The EU government is imposing this cost to the shipping line … But now what that means is the shipping has to take action to decarbonize and naturally that will impact all the consumer. So, I think it’s just a trade-off people will have to live with.”",
        "The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) is set to be extended to the shipping industry starting in January 2024, meaning that large ships entering EU ports will be charged for their carbon dioxide emissions.",
        "The ETS currently covers sectors like mining and aviation and is designed to put a cost on carbon for the region’s most polluting industries.",
        "Chen described the EU initiative as “a natural action that will lead to some interesting effects.”",
        "“Suddenly you need to be able to prove that indeed you’re taking the right action [to decarbonize] and you can see in the shipping line industry some people … are investing in the methanol ships, who are setting up investment funds to go buy those resources, because it’s really hard to buy the alternative fuel. Some are more passive [and] are waiting to see,” he said.",
        "Shipping line Maersk\nlaunched its first vessel with an engine fueled by green methanol in September, but analysts expressed concerns about supply of the alternative fuel.",
        "Shoppers may be willing to spend more on items that have been shipped or produced in a way that “doesn’t create greenhouse gas,” but they will require proof because of the high risk of greenwashing, Chen said.",
        "“Everyone will have to become decarbonized, it’s a question of time. And in that world, what you need is to be able to prove to the end consumer that indeed the action you’re taking is right and that’s something that’s not easy to prove today,” he added.",
        "Using the blockchain to store and give access to legal and financial documents could help the shipping industry provide that proof, Chen said.",
        "Maritime nations agreed in July to reduce emissions “by or around 2050,” during a meeting of the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization.",

        "“I don’t think he’s necessarily trying to regulate the industry as much as maybe curtail it. But he’s created some lawsuits, and I think it’s quite unhelpful for the industry in the U.S. writ large, but it also is an opportunity for Coinbase to go get that clarity from the courts that we feel will really benefit the crypto industry and also the U.S. more broadly.”",

        "Institutional investors lost interest in crypto after 2022 and even with this year’s uptrend, their appetite for it hasn’t come back yet, according to Northern Trust’s head of digital assets and financial markets.",
        "Justin Chapman told CNBC’s “Crypto World” at the Digital Assets Week conference in San Francisco that institutions have shifted their focus to cryptocurrencies’ underlying blockchain technology, but that his firm “has capabilities” in place should client interest in crypto assets rebound.",
        "“Just after March the crypto market went off a cliff… the client interest has definitely gone off the same cliff in terms of institutional interest in in cryptocurrencies,” he said.",
        "“It’s definitely quiet now, since 2022, from the institutional side,” he continued. “Before that, we were seeing traditional fund managers looking to launch crypto funds, ETPs in Europe, which is the equivalent of ETFs in the U.S. — that’s really gone quiet. Even the hedge funds, who are pretty active in the markets, have certainly reduced their exposure within that particular space.”",
        "Meanwhile, leaders from the biggest financial institutions gathered at the San Francisco conference were energized when it came to the blockchain technology – specifically its potential to help tokenize real-world assets like gold for clients.",
        "The “evolution of the technology” is moving into a “better place” in terms of support from market participants, Chapman said.",
        "“As a firm, we have capabilities that sit there to administer [crypto trading] functions, but it’s a pretty quiet market at the moment and [after] most of the issues we had last year, we haven’t seen a rebound at all on the institutional side yet,” he said.",
        "Specifically, Northern Trust partnered with Standard Chartered in 2020 to launch Zodia, a crypto custodian for institutional investors.",
        "Bitcoin\nhas gained almost 75% this year after losing 64% in 2022. Trading was still to begin the year, with volatility falling to historic lows. The regulatory crackdown in the U.S. been a dark cloud over the industry while the banking crisis has helped push bitcoin’s price higher. Both have brought volatility back to the market. Even as bitcoin currently struggles to break above the $30,000 level, investors agree it remains in a long-term uptrend.",
        "“We’re not focused that much on the asset class because the client isn’t at the moment,” Chapman said. “So we’re not seeing that appetite to have that within their portfolios. If that changes, as a firm, we can account for those capabilities. But it’s certainly lost its shine from the institutional perspective.”"

        "The XRP\ncryptocurrency soared on Wednesday as investors grew hopeful that Ripple, a company closely associated with the token, would win its prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",
        "The token was worth around 45 cents at about 8 a.m. ET, according to data from CoinGecko, up over 11% in the last 24 hours. It was earlier trading up as much as 20%.",
        "Traders pointed to a supplemental notice submitted by Ripple on Monday which pointed to a ruling in a separate case concerning Binance.US’ rescue plan for collapsed crypto lender Voyager Digital. Under the plan, Binance’s U.S. unit was to buy all of Voyager’s assets, including its native VGX token, in a $1.3 billion deal.",
        "The SEC rejected the plan, arguing VGX was akin to a security and calling Binance an unregistered securities exchange, according to the notice from Ripple.",
        "However, the judge rejected the SEC’s objections and approved the bankruptcy plan citing what he called the “vagueness” of the regulator’s arguments and stating the SEC had not “offered any guidance at all as to just what it was that the Debtors allegedly were supposed to prove” to demonstrate VGX was not a security, according to the Ripple letter.",
        "The SEC wasn’t immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.",
        "The SEC accuses Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen of breaching U.S. securities laws by selling XRP without first registering it with the regulator. Ripple contests the SEC’s allegations, maintaining the view that XRP should be considered a digital currency rather than a security.",
        "Monica Long, president of Ripple, told CNBC Wednesday morning that she was “very hopeful” about achieving a positive resolution to the SEC battle, adding she thinks it will reach a conclusion sometime this year.",
        "Long said she thinks it’s “very unlikely” the judge will rule in favor of the SEC “considering by our view both the facts and the law are on our side.”",
        "If XRP were to be deemed a security, it could have huge ramifications for the digital currency industry.",
        "Floods of tokens may end up falling into the same category, making them regulated financial instruments that would need SEC supervision and frequent transparency disclosures.",
        "Ripple and the SEC have now both submitted their final round of briefs seeking a summary judgment to the case. The case now rests with Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, who is expected to issue a verdict soon.",

        "XRP “is being bolstered by a potential positive outcome in the SEC case,” Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international at crpyto exchange Luno, told CNBC via email Wednesday.",
        "The token, which is the sixth-largest globally by market value, is also being boosted by the broader crypto market sentiment, Ayyar said.",
        "Bitcoin\nis up 70% since the start of the year and is currently trading above $28,000 for the first time in nine months. Ether\n, the second-biggest token, has risen 50% year-to-date.",
        "“Overall, crypto markets have rallied in the past week or so, given the anticipation of a pause or slow down in interest rates and the slowdown in inflation,” according to Ayyar.",
        "Ripple’s Long said she believed the SEC was regulating through enforcement rather than establishing clear regulations for the sector. Europe is more advanced in its treatment of crypto, she argued, highlighting the bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation as an example.",
        "“We’re seeing action through enforcement vs. setting clear rules and regulation which is what all of us in the industry desire,” Long said.",
        "“Europe is really emerging as a leader in setting really clear regulations and rules that allow crypto companies and also traditional finance to embrace crypto.”",

        "More control over your data. No blockchain. And your own personal artificial intelligence assistant, like ChatGPT.",
        "These are all part of the vision of the future of the web, according to internet inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and CEO of Inrupt John Bruce, who spoke on CNBC’s Beyond The Valley podcast published Friday.",
        "Inrupt is a company they co-founded which aims to deliver the web inventors’ original vision of the way the internet should work.",
        "Berners-Lee said that when he invented the web in 1989, “if you were sufficiently switched on geeky, you could get yourself a computer. And you could put a web server on it, you could plug it into the internet. And you could have a website.”",
        "“The spirit of the web was incredibly empowering to individuals,” he said.",
        "But in his view, something has gone wrong since, with the concentration of power now in the hands of large internet companies.",
        "“Well, everybody’s on Facebook\n, so they don’t have the website. They all use Mark Zuckerberg’s website,” Berners-Lee said.",
        "“When people look you up on Facebook, you don’t control actually what they see ... Mark Zuckerberg’s algorithms control what news gets fed to them as they’re looking at your stuff,” he told CNBC.",
        "“That’s very disempowering. It is very useful to Facebook. They have a lot of data about people that they they use for targeting them with advertisements ... but what we’ve lost is the ability for individuals to have power.”",
        "His solution? A product that allows users to control their data and how it’s used. Currently, internet companies collect data on users by default, as a way of using their services.",
        "But Berners-Lee and Bruce’s start-up Inrupt is working on a different way forward. The aim is for users to have a single sign-on across different products and services on the internet.",
        "Data will be stored in so-called “pods,” which are basically a person’s personal data online storage container. Individuals can grant a website or service access to their pod, or silo of data, rather than websites taking data by default.",
        "The system is built on an open protocol on the internet called Solid.",
        "“And that’s the ‘yin’ and the ‘yang’ of Inrupt, which is the personal empowerment. And the opportunity for individuals to take more command over their role on the web,” Bruce told CNBC’s Beyond The Valley.",
        "Such an idea would require buy-in from large internet players. But Bruce said there is an “endless trudge” from companies to get more data on users, so they can target them with products and services. But the endeavour is showing diminishing returns for companies, he said.",
        "“The other way of doing it is instead of, you know, figuring out blindly ‘Are you the likely candidate for my product or service?’ How about I just ask you in a legitimate way? And you tell me,” Bruce said, referencing the idea that users would be able to share the data that they want with companies from their pod.",
        "Users will also need to change their behavior, and there needs to be a desire to control their data in this way. Berners-Lee admitted this change wouldn’t come overnight but instead “bit by bit.”",
        "In the wide-ranging Beyond The Valley episode, Bruce and Berners-Lee also addressed new artificial intelligence product ChatGPT which was developed by OpenAI.",
        "Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot, that responds to questions from users.",
        "Berners-Lee said that users can run their own AI, much like their own personal version of Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, when they have their own data pods.",
        "That’s because in the future that Berners-Lee sees, users will have all sorts of data stored in their pods — from fitness information to online shopping habits. The AI could use all that data to learn and be able to assist a user.",
        "“Sometimes you have the whole data spectrum — all of the data to do with your collaborations and your coffees and your projects and your dreams. And the books you’re reading and ... all of your life, then that is in your pod. You run AI on that. That could be sweet,” Berners-Lee said.",
        "What Berners-Lee and Bruce are working on at Inrupt is all part of the future of the internet.",
        "Some have termed it Web3, which proponents say will be a decentralized version of the internet — one that is not dominated by a handful of powerful players such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.",
        "Many Web3 advocates suggest it will be built on some sort of blockchain technology. Blockchain is the technology that first came to light with bitcoin but has since evolved.",
        "But Berners-Lee is keen to call the next generation of the internet Web 3.0, emphasizing the dot.",
        "“It’s not blockchain,” he said.",
        "Web3 proponents suggest blockchain could be used to underpin the future of the internet. But Berners-Lee said the technology is not fast enough nor does it afford enough privacy.",
        "He also said cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are “only speculative.”",
        "Gavin Wood, founder of blockchain infrastructure company Parity Technologies, coined the term “Web3.”",
        "Wood spoke to CNBC last year about his vision for the future of the web in a previous episode of Beyond the Valley. He advocated blockchain technology as part of the future web make-up."

        "According to the SEC, Genesis loaned Gemini users’ crypto and sent a portion of the profits back to Gemini, which then deducted an agent fee, sometimes over 4%, and returned the remaining profit to its users.

The agency is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties against both Genesis and Gemini, and noted that “investigations into other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing.”",
        "The two firms have been engaged in a high-profile battle over $900 million in customer assets that Gemini entrusted to Genesis as part of the Earn program, which was shuttered this week.

        "The exchange plans to cut 950 jobs, according to a blog post published Tuesday morning. Coinbase\n, which had roughly 4,700 employees as of the end of September, already slashed 18% of its workforce in June citing a need to manage costs and growing “too quickly” during the bull market.",
        "“With perfect hindsight, looking back, we should have done more,” CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in a phone interview. “The best you can do is react quickly once information becomes available, and that’s what we’re doing in this case.”",
        "Coinbase said the move would result in new expenses of between $149 million and $163 million for the first quarter. The layoffs, along with other restructuring measures, will bring Coinbase’s operating expenses down by 25% for the quarter ending in March, according to a new regulatory filing. The crypto company also said it expects adjusted EBITDA losses for the full year to be within a prior $500 million “guardrail” set last year.",
        "After looking at various stress tests for Coinbase’s annual revenue, Armstrong said, “it became clear that we would need to reduce expenses to increase our chances of doing well in every scenario” and there was “no way” to do so without reducing head count. The company will also be shutting down several projects with a “lower probability of success.”",
        "Cryptocurrency markets have been rocked in recent months following the collapse of one of the industry’s biggest players, FTX. Armstrong pointed to that fallout, and increasing pressure on the sector thanks to “unscrupulous actors in the industry” referring to FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. ",
        "“The FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry,” he said, adding there’s likely more “shoes to drop.”",
        "“We may not have seen the last of it — there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to make sure that they’re following the rules,” Armstrong said. “Long term that’s a good thing. But short term, there’s still a lot of market fear.” ",
        "Cryptocurrencies have suffered alongside technology stocks as investors flee riskier assets amid a broader economic downturn. Bitcoin is down 58% in the past year, while Coinbase shares are off by more than 83%.",
        "Coinbase joins a chorus of other tech companies cutting jobs after going on a hiring binge during the Covid pandemic. Last week, Amazon\nsaid it would cut 18,000 jobs, more than the online retailer initially estimated last year, while Salesforce\nreduced its head count by more than 7,000, or 10%. Elon Musk slashed about half of Twitter’s workforce after taking the helm as CEO last year, and Meta\ncut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13%. Crypto companies Genesis, Gemini and Kraken have also reduced their workforces. ",
        "“Every company in Silicon Valley felt like we were just focused on growth, growth, growth, and people were almost using their headcount number as a symbol of how much progress they were making,” Armstrong said. “The focus now is on operational efficiency -- it’s a healthy thing for the ecosystem and the industry to focus more on those things.”",
        "Early last year, Coinbase had said it planned to add 2,000 jobs across product, engineering and design. Armstrong said he’s now trying to shift the culture at Coinbase to “get back to its start-up roots” of smaller teams that can move quickly. ",
        "Coinbase went public in April 2021 and has seen its share price plummet since. The stock is trading below $40 after surging as high as $429.54 on the day of its debut. Coinbase debt that’s maturing in 2031 continues to trade at roughly 50 cents on the dollar. The company still had cash and equivalents of roughly $5 billion as of the end of September. ",
        "Coinbase said it would email affected employees on their personal accounts, and revoke access to company systems. Armstrong acknowledged the latter “feels sudden and harsh” but “it’s the only prudent choice given our responsibility to protect customer information.”",
        "Despite the industry’s domino effect of bankruptcies and a marked drop in trading volume, Armstrong was steadfast in arguing that the industry isn’t going away. He said the demise of FTX would ultimately benefit Coinbase, as its largest competitor is now wiped out. Regulatory clarity may also emerge, and Armstrong said it “validates” the company’s decision of building and going public in the U.S. The CEO likened the current environment to the dot-com boom and bust.",
        "“If you look at the internet era, the best companies got even stronger by having rigorous cost management,” he said. “That’s what’s going to happen here.”"

        "Michael Rubin’s sports platform company Fanatics is divesting its 60% stake in NFT company Candy Digital, according to an internal email obtained by CNBC.",
        "Fanatics, who previously held the majority share of Candy Digital, will be selling its interest to an investor group led by Galaxy Digital, the crypto merchant bank led by Mike Novogratz, which was the other original founding shareholder, according to the email.",
        "Fanatics declined to comment.",
        "Candy Digital was founded in June 2021 in the middle of the sports NFT boom, competing with companies like Dapper Labs in the digital sports collectible space. One of its first efforts came out of a multiyear licensing agreement with MLB to produce nonfungible tokens, which included an exclusive Lou Gehrig NFT. It also released digital collectibles with Netflix\n’s Stranger Things, WWE\n, and several Nascar teams.",
        "However, akin to the broader NFT market, sports NFTs also saw a decline amid the ‘crypto winter’ that has seen the value of nearly all digital assets plummet. Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day digital trading platforms that ranked No. 9 on last year’s CNBC Disruptor 50 list, laid off 22% of its company in November.",
        "Candy Digital had raised a $100 million Series A round in October 2021, valuing it at $1.5 billion at the time. Investors in that round included SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2, Insight Partners, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, according to previous CNBC reporting.",
        "It is unclear what Fanatics received for its stake in the company, but Rubin wrote “Divesting our ownership stake at this time allowed us to ensure investors were able to recoup most of their investment via cash or additional shares in Fanatics – a favorable outcome for investors, especially in an imploding NFT market that has seen precipitous drops in both transaction volumes and prices for standalone NFTs.”",
        "Rubin cited several factors for Fanatics’ divesture in the email, which he wrote was a “rather straightforward and easy decision for us to make for several reasons.”",
        "“Over the past year, it has become clear that NFTs are unlikely to be sustainable or profitable as a standalone business,” Rubin wrote. “Aside from physical collectibles (trading cards) driving 99% of the business, we believe digital products will have more value and utility when connected to physical collectibles to create the best experience for collectors.”",
        "In January 2022, Fanatics acquired Topps trading cards for roughly $500 million after also acquiring the rights to produce MLB trading cards, severing a nearly 70-year partnership between Topps and baseball’s top league.",
        "Fanatics raised $700 million in fresh capital in December, aiming to use that new money to focus on potential merger and acquisition opportunities across its collectibles, betting and gaming businesses. It also pushed the company’s valuation to $31 billion.",
        "The company, which started as an e-commerce platform selling team merchandise to sports fans, has looked to expand across the entire sports ecosystem. The company is also weighing an initial public offering, and Rubin recently met with more than 90 internet, retail and gaming analysts from various Wall Street firms, where he spoke of Fanatics’ growth plans, according to previous CNBC reporting.",
        "Fanatics, a three-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, was ranked No. 21 on last year’s list.",
        "Here’s the full email Rubin sent to Fanatics staff on Wednesday:",
        "Team Fanatics –",
        "Happy New Year. I hope everyone had a chance to recharge and spend quality time with family and friends during the holidays, and that your 2023 is off to a great start.",
        "As we’re getting back into the swing of things, I wanted to share some news with all of you. Effective immediately, Fanatics has divested our approximately 60% stake in Candy Digital. We have sold our interest in the NFT company to an investor group led by Galaxy Digital, the other original founding shareholder. When we looked at all the factors on the table, this was a rather straightforward and easy decision for us to make for several reasons.",
        "Business Model – NFTs will most likely emerge as an integrated product/feature and not as a standalone business: Over the past year, it has become clear that NFTs are unlikely to be sustainable or profitable as a standalone business. Aside from physical collectibles (trading cards) driving 99% of the business, we believe digital products will have more value and utility when connected to physical collectibles to create the best experience for collectors. To that end, we already hold a broader and more significant set of NFT and digital collectibles rights within our Fanatics Collectibles business that came with our trading cards rights (NFL, MLB, NBA and more), which we are seamlessly integrating with the world-class physical collectibles rights we currently have. Ultimately, our goal is to grow the number of sports collectors. Connectivity between physical and digital collectibles will be the most powerful way to create an emotional resonance and enduring success for NFTs and their collectors.",
        "Investor Relationships: Taking this immediate action not only makes sense for the strategic direction of Fanatics, but also allows us to maintain the integrity of the relationships with our investors. The investors in Candy bought into the vision not because of NFTs or Candy itself, but because of our track record at Fanatics. This proven track record is a result of your hard work and our alignment on the mission to build the leading global digital sports platform. Therefore, it was imperative to us to protect their investment as the market and financial environment changed. Divesting our ownership stake at this time allowed us to ensure investors were able to recoup most of their investment via cash or additional shares in Fanatics – a favorable outcome for investors, especially in an imploding NFT market that has seen precipitous drops in both transaction volumes and prices for standalone NFTs.",
        "Cultural Integration: Similar to how quickly we mobilize when the right strategic acquisition or partnership presents itself, we move even quicker when we realize things aren’t working. One of our core values – One Fanatics…Win As A Team – is integral to our success and only works when we can leverage the collective intelligence and expertise of all of our teams and colleagues. Unfortunately, we never achieved full integration of Candy within the Fanatics environment or culture due to shareholders with competing objectives and goals. Our culture of building, growing and winning as a team is what makes this company special, and we were not willing to compromise on this front.",
        "We are 100% confident that this was the best long-term decision for Fanatics and our partners and we look forward to growing our digital and trading cards business together under Fanatics Collectibles with the incredible rights we have across the NFL, MLB, NBA, NCAA, WWE, UFC, F1, UEFA, Disney and more.",
        "Happy New Year to all,",
        "Michael Rubin",

        "2022 was a rough year for crypto. More than $1.3 trillion was wiped off the value of the market. And bitcoin, the world’s largest digital coin, saw its price slump more than 60%.",
        "Investors were caught off guard by a wave of collapses in the industry from stablecoin project terraUSD to crypto exchange FTX, as well as a worsening macroeconomic climate. Those who made predictions about bitcoin’s price in the past year really missed the mark.",
        "But with 2023 now here, some market players have stuck their neck out with price calls for what could be another volatile year.",
        "Interest rates around the world are on the rise, and that’s weighing on risk assets like stocks and bitcoin. Investors are also watching how the FTX saga, which resulted in the arrest of the company’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas, will develop.",
        "CNBC rounds up some of the boldest price calls for bitcoin in 2023.",
        "Bitcoin bull Tim Draper had one of the most optimistic calls on bitcoin of 2022, predicting the token would be worth $250,000 by the end of the year.",
        "In November, the billionaire venture capitalist said he’s extending the timeline for that prediction until mid-2023. Even after the collapse of FTX, he’s convinced the coin will hit the quarter-of-a-million milestone.",
        "“My assumption is that since women control 80% of retail spending, and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women that the dam is about to break,” Draper told CNBC via email.",
        "Bitcoin would need to rally 1,400% in order for it to trade at that level.",
        "Despite the depressed prices and trading volumes drying up, there could be reason to suspect the market has found a bottom, according to Draper.",
        "“I suspect that the halvening in 2024 will have a positive run,” he said.",
        "The halvening, or halving, is an event that happens every four years in which bitcoin rewards to miners are cut in half. This is viewed by some investors as positive for bitcoin’s price, as it squeezes supply. The next halving is slated to happen sometime in 2024.",
        "Bitcoin miners, who use power-intensive machines to verify transactions and mint new tokens, are being squeezed by the slump in prices and rising energy costs.",
        "These actors accumulate massive piles of digital currency, making them some of the biggest sellers in the market. With miners offloading their holdings to pay off debts, that should remove most of the remaining selling pressure on bitcoin.",
        "This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts",

        "Morgan Stanley picks ‘alpha’ opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside",
        "That’s historically a good sign for bitcoin, said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development at crypto exchange Luno.",
        "“In prior down markets, miner capitulation has usually indicated major bottoms,” Ayyar told CNBC. “Their cost to produce becomes greater than the value of bitcoin, hence you have a number of miners either switching off their machines … or they need to sell more bitcoin to keep their business afloat.”",
        "“If the market reaches a point where it’s absorbing this miner sell pressure sufficiently, one can assume that we’re seeing a bottoming period.”",
        "For some market participants, the worst is yet to come.",
        "In a Dec. 5 research note, Standard Chartered said bitcoin may sink as low as $5,000. The prediction, one of the bank’s list of “surprises” that are being “under-priced” by markets, would represent a 70% plunge from current prices.",
        "“Yields plunge along with technology shares” in Standard Chartered’s nightmare 2023 scenario, “and while the Bitcoin sell-off decelerates, the damage has been done,” said Eric Robertsen, the bank’s global head of research.",
        "“More and more crypto firms and exchanges find themselves with insufficient liquidity, leading to further bankruptcies and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets,” he added.",
        "Robertsen said the scenario has a “non-zero probability of occurring in the year ahead” and falls “materially outside of the market consensus or our own baseline views.”",
        "Veteran investor Mark Mobius had a relatively successful 2022 in terms of his price call. In May, he forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000.",
        "He said bitcoin would fall to $10,000 in 2022. That did not happen. However, Mobius told CNBC that he is sticking for his $10,000 price call in 2023.",
        "The investor, who made his name at Franklin Templeton Investments, told CNBC that his bear case for bitcoin stemmed from rising interest rates and general tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
        "“With higher interest rates, the attraction of holding or buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies becomes less attractive since just holding the coin does not pay interest,” Mobius said via email.",
        "Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, wasn’t far off the mark with her prediction that bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022.",
        "Now, she thinks the cryptocurrency could be set for gains — but not for reasons you might expect.",
        "The catalyst would be more dominos from the FTX fallout tipping over, Alexander said. If this happens, she expects the price of bitcoin will top $30,000 in the first quarter, and then $50,000 by quarters three or four.",
        "“There will be a managed bull market in 2023, not a bubble — so we won’t see the price overshooting as before,” she told CNBC.",
        "“We’ll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes.”",
        "Alexander’s reasoning is that, with trading volumes evaporating with traders on edge, large holders known as “whales” will likely step in to prop up the market. The wealthiest 97 bitcoin wallet addresses account for 14.15% of the total supply, according to fintech firm River Financial.",
        "Some investors have given up trying to predict the price of bitcoin. For Antoni Trenchev, CEO of crypto lending platform Nexo, the recent events are a sobering moment.",
        "Bitcoin was on a “positive path” earlier in 2022, with institutional adoption rising, but “a few major forces interfered,” he said.",
        "Trenchev once predicted bitcoin surging to a peak of $100,000 by early 2023. Now, he’s done trying to predict the price.",
        "Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, suggested attempts to forecast bitcoin’s price are futile.",
        "“We could be sitting here talking this time next year and it could be at $5,000 or 50,000 it just wouldn’t surprise me because the market is so heavily driven by sentiment,” he told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”"

        "FTX connected buyers and sellers of digital currencies like bitcoin\n, as well as derivatives. However, the company did more than that, allegedly dipping into client accounts to make risky trades through its sister firm Alameda Research.",
        "“It’s hugely disappointing for investors, or more so devastating for investors,” said Louise Abbott, a partner at law firm Keystone Law who specializing in crypto-asset recovery and fraud.",
        "It’s clear the FTX drama could radically reshape crypto in the years to come. Here are three big ways the industry could change.",
        "For one, the disaster will looks certain to stir regulators into action.",
        "Crypto as an industry is still largely unregulated, meaning investors don’t have the same protections they would have placing their funds with a licensed bank or broker.",
        "That may be about to change. Governments in the U.S., European Union and the U.K. are taking steps to clean up the market.",
        "The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets is the most comprehensive regulatory framework to date. It aims to reduce the risks for consumers buying crypto, making exchanges liable if they lose investors’ assets.",
        "But MICA is not due to start until 12 months from now. Keystone Law’s Abbott said it’s important that regulators act quickly.",
        "“People need to see that there’s steps being taken to regulate it. And I think If we are able to offer some regulation, we will build confidence,” she said. “If there’s no regulation, the investors are left without that protection that they need.”",

        "The saga has set back adoption of crypto assets by “one or two years,” according to Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute.",
        "“Everything that failed this year, if you look at Celsius, Three Arrows, FTX now — all those guys were taking the worst of both worlds because they were not completely decentralized, and they were not properly centralized either,” he said.",
        "For Kevin de Patoul, CEO of crypto market maker Keyrock, the biggest lesson from FTX’s bankruptcy is that “you cannot have complete centralization and lack of oversight.”",
        "“We are evolving to a world where you are going to have both centralization and decentralization,” he said. “When you do have that centralization, you need to have proper oversight and a proper balance of power.”",
        "Many new companies and projects emerged in the years that followed the 2018 crypto winter — FTX among them. The expectation now is that fewer firms and coins will exist in the years to come.",
        "Contagion from the FTX saga is already playing out.",
        "Crypto lender BlockFi, which earlier sought financial assistance from FTX, has entered bankruptcy. Now, attention is turning to other trading and lending firms, like Gemini and Genesis.",
        "“The challenge for the whole space when you think about contagion is that FTX and Alameda were extremely active investors in this space,” Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain.com, said in a CNBC-moderated talk at a crypto conference in London.",
        "Near Foundation, which is behind a blockchain network called Near, was among the firms that took investment from FTX. Marieke Flament, Near’s CEO, said the firm had limited exposure to FTX — though the collapse was still “a surprise and a shock.”",
        "“I don’t think all the dominoes have fallen out from the contagion,” Flament said. “The impact that this will have is that a lot of projects actually are not going to have the funds, and therefore the resources, for them to continue and develop.”",
        "Fears have risen over the financial health of other major crypto exchanges after FTX’s failure. Since early 2020, about 900,000 bitcoins have flowed out of exchanges, according to data from CryptoQuant.",
        "Binance, the world’s largest exchange, is facing questions about the reserves it holds to backstop customer funds. The company saw billions of dollars in outflows in the past week.",
        "Currently, there is no reason to suspect Binance faces any risk of bankruptcy. But exchanges like Binance and Coinbase\nface a bleak market backdrop ahead amid falling trading volumes and account balances.",
        "Experts believe they’ll continue to play a role — though their survival will be determined by how seriously they take risk management, governance and regulation. ",
        "“There will be exchanges that are doing things the right way and that will survive,” said Abbott.",
        "As for tokens — bitcoin\n, being the longest-living digital currency, may be better positioned than its smaller rivals.",
        "“My bet would be that bitcoin and DeFi [decentralized finance] are decoupled from the rest of crypto and actually start to have a life of its own,” Gaevoy from Wintermute told CNBC.",
        "Despite the depressed state of crypto markets, and the toll it’s taken on investors, the digital asset industry is likely to pull through.",
        "Proponents of “Web3,” a hypothetical blockchain-based internet, expect 2022′s crypto winter to pave the way for more innovative uses of blockchain, rather than the speculative uses crypto is associated with today.",
        "“What we’re seeing a lot is companies having digital innovation arms or metaverse innovation arms,” Flament said. “They understand that the technology is here. It’s not going to go away.”",
        "NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, could alter users’ relationships with properties in games and events, for example. These are digital assets that track ownership of unique virtual items on the blockchain.",
        "“Digital assets will be an increasing part of our lives, whether that is a collectible, a ticket, value, identity,” Ian Rogers, chief experience officer at crypto wallet firm Ledger, told CNBC. “Identity could be membership ... [people] using NFTs they own to get access to a particular event or something like that.”",
        "But for many, there’s still a learning curve to overcome. “It’s hard creating wallets and storing keys and going through different platforms,” Cordel Robbin-Coker, CEO of mobile games firm Carry1st, told CNBC at the Slush startup conference in Helsinki, Finland.",
        "Robbin-Coker compared Web3 today with the internet in the early 90s. “It was clunky. You had dial-up, it took four minutes to get on, the original web browsers were not very intuitive,” he said.",
        "“It’s really the early adopters that really engage at that stage. But over time, companies build smoother interfaces. And they cut steps out of it.”"

        "The creator of the iPod, Tony Fadell, designed a new hardware wallet for people to store their cryptocurrency.",
        "The product, created by French crypto asset security firm Ledger, launched at the company’s annual Ledger Op3n event Tuesday. Its launch comes at a time when trust in centralized crypto platforms is fading as a result of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.",
        "It’s called Ledger Stax and resembles a small smartphone or credit card reader. Measuring 85 millimeters long and 54 millimeters wide, it’s roughly the same size as a credit card. It is also about 45 grams, weighing less than an iPhone. Users can deposit or exchange a range of tokens, including bitcoin\n, ether, cardano, solana and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs.",
        "The Ledger Stax sports a black-and-white E-ink display, similar to that of Amazon’s Kindle e-readers. It also includes magnets, so that multiple devices can be stacked on top of each other, like a pile of books or cash — hence the name Stax. Users can connect it to their laptop through a USB cable or their phone via Bluetooth.",
        "“Many Ledger owners have multiple devices, some store their NFTs, some store different crypto, some have multiple because they have different clients that they store for,” Fadell told CNBC in an interview.",
        "The display also has a spine that curves around the edge, “so you can see what’s on each one, just like an old CD or cassette tape or book,” he said.",
        "Initially, Fadell turned down working with the Ledger team on Stax. “This was not something I wanted to do,” he said. “When they first approached me I’m like, ‘I don’t want to do it. No thank you.’ I was interested in crypto, I had crypto at the time but I’ve basically got a lot of other things to do.”",
        "Fadell later went on to purchase a few older Ledger devices. He found that, like MP3 players in 1999, people didn’t know what to make of the devices.",
        "They were also difficult to use, he said. “It didn’t feel like it was ready for mass consumer, or at least early adopter consumer markets,” said Fadell. “Not just business to geeks, we had to go to business to consumer.”",
        "The tech design guru — who previously co-founded the Nest smart thermostat before it was acquired by Google in 2014  — then decided to help the Ledger team.",
        "“This reminds me a lot of the iPod,” he said.",
        "The Ledger Stax, which retails at $279, is available for preorder starting Tuesday and will start shipping in the first quarter of 2023, Ledger said.",
        "It’s not the first time a company has tried launching a smartphone focused on blockchain and cryptocurrencies.",
        "In 2018, during the last so-called “crypto winter,” HTC launched the Exodus 1, a mid-range phone with a crypto wallet included. Swiss startup Sirin Labs launched its own phone with a “cold” wallet, called Finney. And blockchain platform Solana this year debuted its own Android phone for “Web3,” named Saga.",
        "Such devices have largely struggled to gain any traction with consumers.",
        "Ian Rogers, Ledger’s chief experience officer and a former executive at Apple and LVMH, said he’s confident about the mass market potential.",
        "“There’s no question about the need for security and there’s no question that we lead increasingly online lives,” he told CNBC. “Instagram\n, Nike\n, Starbucks\n, Amazon\n— many companies are finding real life use cases for digital assets. And so I think that we will grow with that.”",
        "After the recent collapse of FTX into insolvency, crypto holders have sought alternative means of storing their digital assets. One is via cold storage, where a user’s private key — the code they need to access their account — is kept on a device that’s not connected to the internet.",
        "Since these wallets are offline, they’re less susceptible to hacks or failures. Ledger says that, to date, none of its devices have been hacked.",
        "Ledger has seen a boost in sales as a result of fears around the contagion from the FTX collapse. Last week, BlockFi, a crypto lender, entered bankruptcy after revealing Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried’s trading firm, defaulted on $680 million worth of loans from the company.",
        "November “will be our all-time high biggest month ever,” Pascal Gauthier, Ledger’s CEO, told CNBC. “All the news that you’ve seen since the beginning of the year, from Celsius all the way to FTX, has really pushed a lot of users towards self custody.”",
        "Ledger has sold more than 5 million devices to date.",
        "However, a sharp downturn in digital asset prices could spell trouble for the company with retail investors becoming more wary. Only 21% of Americans feel comfortable investing in cryptocurrency, according to Bankrate’s September survey. That’s down from 35% in 2021.",
        "The Ledger Stax will compete with a slew of consumer gadgets this holiday shopping season, including Apple’s new iPhone 14, at a time when budgets are being constrained by rising inflation."

        "Blockchain analytics company Elliptic estimates that around $477 million worth of cryptocurrency had been stolen from FTX.",
        "The theft adds insult to injury to FTX, a once $32 billion crypto empire who collapse has sent shockwaves across the industry.",
        "The stolen money has been converted into different digital coins but the bulk of it — more than $280 million — was changed into the cryptocurrency ether\n, according to public blockchain records of the account linked to the hackers.",
        "Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, told CNBC that the hackers were converting the ether into a crypto product called RenBTC which is then being converted into bitcoin via a bridge. This allows one crypto to be converted into another without going through a centralized exchange.",
        "“This is a common tactic in the laundering of crypto thefts,” Robinson said.",
        "Elliptic researchers have documented how RenBridge has been used to launder “hundreds of millions” of dollars in cryptocurrency suspected of being sourced from ransomware attacks or hacks. Some of those hacks have connections to Russian-backed ransomware groups, according to Elliptic.",
        "So far, $74 million has been moved to bitcoin from RenBTC using RenBridge.",
        "Alameda, a trading firm and sister company to FTX, acquired RenBridge in 2021 as part of FTX’s broader efforts to build out Solana and Serum.",
        "Serum is a “decentralized exchange,” with a Serum token running natively on Solana, promising users faster settlement and execution times. FTX and Alameda were large backers of the project, which was forked in an attempt to prevent FTX control following the bankruptcy.",
        "On Nov. 11, FTX users noted unusual transfers of cryptocurrency, sparking fears that FTX’s platform had been compromised. Posts in FTX’s Telegram thread indicated that the app and platform had in fact been infiltrated and compromised.",
        "Further allegations that Bankman-Fried worked with the regulators in the Bahamas to move crypto out of FTX wallets came after a Vox interview — which Bankman-Fried would later claim he understood as a casual conversation with a reporter friend — in which the ex-CEO of FTX pinned the suspected theft of FTX crypto on a disgruntled employee. ",
        "FTX filings said they discovered the Bahamian transfers while investigating the weekend crypto theft. What those filings left unanswered was if those two were one and the same, or two separate occurrences.",
        "It is yet unclear how much the assets that Bahamian regulators took into custody are worth. CNBC reported on an emergency court filing by FTX on Nov. 18 to stop further action by the Bahamas regulators. FTX filings alleged that Bankman-Fried was possibly working in concert with those regulators.",
        "Hackers are some point will want to cash that money out into fiat. However, Robinson said that will be “challenging” due to the “traceability of crypto.”",
        "He said that he expects the hackers to use “mixers to cover their blockchain trail.”",
        "Mixers are services or software that allow a crypto transaction trail to be obfuscated on the blockchain, making it difficult or impossible to trace these funds, Robinson said.",
        "“This may be one of the motivations behind moving these assets to bitcoin — the greater availability of mixing services,” he added.",
        "The blockchain is a public ledger of crypto activity. Each coin may have its own blockchain. That makes it possible to trace, to an extent, where funds are moving. The use of mixers could make this difficult.",
        "Crypto compliance software company Chainalysis in a tweet on Sunday also confirmed that hackers are moving funds.",
        "FTX on Sunday urged cryptocurrency exchanges to keep an eye out for the stolen funds if the hackers try to process the money via one of their services.",
        "“Exchanges should take all measures to secure these funds to be returned to the bankruptcy estate,” FTX said in another tweet.",
        "FTX owes its largest creditors some $3.1 billion, according to court filings. Put another way, the hacked money is about 15% of what FTX owes its biggest clients alone.",
        "Bankman-Fried once oversaw a sprawling crypto empire that spanned every inhabited continent and claimed billions in assets. The implosion of FTX has left Bankman-Fried a paper pauper and investors left unable to access their crypto assets."

        "To join the CNBC Technology Executive Council, go to cnbccouncils.com/tec",
        "Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin thinks the correction in the equity markets has turned into a positive, especially for tech companies that “had gotten to craziness” and now present some good opportunities. But one overvalued tech bet he never liked was bankrupt crypto trading firm FTX, which collapsed spectacularly from a $32 billion valuation to a bankruptcy filing and criminal investigations amid allegations of misuse of customer assets.",
        "“We looked at investment twice, and passed both times,” Mnuchin said at the CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit in New York on Tuesday.",
        "Mnuchin, who has managed private equity investments since leaving the Trump administration, stressed that his decision was unrelated to current allegations that FTX misused customer funds, which he described as “concerning” but said he first learned about in the press. “There’s lots that needs to be understood and I am just watching outside now. I did not expect it would unwind nearly as quickly, and if indeed customer funds were misused those are very serious issues,” he said.",
        "Mnuchin did not want to get into details related to his decision-making on FTX in an interview at the TEC Summit with CNBC’s Melissa Lee, but did say that the second time he passed on making an investment, the crypto trading firm was “five times the valuation” it had been before.",
        "“We were a bit surprised by the overall level of valuation,” Mnuchin said.",
        "Last week, venture capital firm Sequoia marked down its investment in FTX to zero, among the major institutional investors caught up in the collapse. Mnuchin said top investors getting caught up in the fear of missing out hype cycle is nothing new. “We’ve seen in a lot of tech companies where we had very smart investors invested at ridiculous valuations,” he said.",
        "In the recent bull market, that FOMO spread well beyond crypto. “You had people doing an investment a day in tech,” Mnuchin said at the CNBC event. “I just don’t see how you can do 300 investments a year and think you can do due diligence on them and pick winners from losers,” he said. “Valuations reflected everything being perfect in the world.”",
        "But now, he added, “it’s a much better environment for investing.”",
        "The former Treasury Secretary believes that we have seen the peak in inflation and the Fed rate-hiking cycle may end a little lower, at 4.5%, than the market’s worst-case scenario. Those rate hikes will still take some time to work their way through the economy and contribute to some more potential downside in the markets, but the correction in equities and tech stocks has been a healthy thing, Mnuchin said, whose private equity firm Liberty Strategic Capital has a focus on technology investments.",
        "Mnuchin, who once held a top tech post at Goldman Sachs, remains a believer and investor in the underlying blockchain technology, which he said has interesting applications.",
        "“We’ve been more focused on the infrastructure side of crypto than the assets and trading side of the business,” he said.",
        "He also thinks there is a middle ground on regulation to be struck in the wake of the FTX implosion.",
        "“The problem is there needs to be more clarity on regulation,” he said, pointing to a current U.S. approach which delegates regulatory authority among entities including the CFTC, FTC, the SEC and the Treasury — where he focused on crypto market transparency and money laundering.",
        "He also pointed to the offshore entities involved in the FTX situation, and said while it had a U.S. company, crypto remains an industry where “people move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction” in a game of “regulatory arbitrage.”",
        "The most important outcome, Mnuchin said, is that the U.S. does not go from one extreme to another, from a lack of regulation to over-regulation. “There are very important innovations in this industry,” he said. Though he added that the allegations of misuse of customer funds in the FTX case do point to a foundational principal in financial regulation. “We need to have segregation of customer funds. It’s one of the fundamental premises we rely upon,” Mnuchin said."

In one case, a collectible that traded near $9 three weeks ago sold for $10 million on Friday. Another NFT that was similarly priced a month ago, sold for $888,888.88 this week.",
        "“This NFT activity is highly irregular at a macro level when the NFT market overall is declining, both in value and in volume, and in this specific case when there is limited trading on other FTX markets,” said Owen Rapaport, cofounder and CEO of Argus, a blockchain analytics company that specializes in insider trading.",

        "Argus said this type of trading is likely an attempt by FTX users to access money in any way they can. One likely possibility, according to Rapaport, is that traders have an agreement with the Bahamian users to pay some percentage of the assets, and in return receive them once they’ve been successfully withdrawn from FTX.",

Meanwhile, data firm Elliptic estimates that $473 million has been moved off of FTX in a suspected hack.",

        "This week’s FTX collapse is “a tragedy and total failure of governance,” Blockchain.com CEO and co-founder Peter Smith told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Thursday, but it’s not going to sink the crypto economy by any stretch.",
        "According to Smith, the rapid downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s company will accelerate a trend back towards regulated crypto institutions as well as a shift back towards individuals holding crypto assets on their own private keys. ",
        "“Crypto is one of the very few assets in the world that you can custody yourself, and I think we’re going to see folks increasingly move back to that model as well as move to a model of trusting regulated companies in the space,” Smith said. ",
        "Smith said the overall crypto and blockchain economies, and companies like his that rely on private funding, should not face major barriers in receiving money from investors. He said for all the hype — FTX was recently valued at as much as $32 billion though investors had marked it down to zero this week — FTX was not a market leader or key player in the crypto ecosystem. It was, Smith says, highly popular within Silicon Valley-based groups, which was confusing to him since investors were excited about the company which had very low levels of governance.",
        "The FTX situation will lead more investors to focus on corporate structure in crypto moving forward.",
        "“This was very much a Silicon Valley momentum play, and we’ve seen that very clearly not work out,” Smith said. ",
        "Some analysts have said crypto exchange Coinbase could be among the companies to benefit from a greater focus on regulated entities. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase\n, which announced additional layoffs on Thursday, told CNBC on Thursday afternoon the relatively small number of job cuts were related to the overall market conditions and need to manage costs and cash as a public company.",
        "SEC Commissioner Gary Gensler told CNBC on Thursday that the American public needs to “be careful, beware. There’s still a lot of noncompliance and when you give somebody your token, and they go down, you’re going to just stand in line at a bankruptcy court and they may be taking your token and doing all sorts of things without proper disclosure. Now, if it’s one to one back, and there’s really good disclosure, and your protect against fraud, manipulation, that’s all we’re saying. That’s what the securities laws are.”",
        "In response to a question about Coinbase and Binance (FTX’s would-be acquirer), Gensler added, “I am not going to speak to any one platform, but I would say that you have these rules and the laws are clear, but do not assume that these firms are complying with the rules and the laws that the New York Stock Exchange or the biggest brokerage apps are complying with.”",
        "Armstrong pushed back in his interview, saying that as a public company, concerns about crypto custody are a “non-issue.”",
        "“We hold customer funds one to one backed,” he said. As a public company, he added, it has financial statements audited by big four accounting firms. “What happened to FTX is not possible to happen at Coinbase, and we are a regulated institution in the U.S.,” Armstrong said.",
        "Blockchain.com, which came in at No. 7 in CNBC’s 2022 Disruptor 50 list, is the company behind approximately a third of all bitcoin network transactions since 2012.",
        "“The ultimate reality and the coolest part of crypto is that you can store your funds on your own private key where you have no counterparty exposure,” Smith said. “And it’s been our mission to enable that for the last decade.”",

        "SINGAPORE — Singapore still wants to be a hub for digital assets, but not one for speculating on cryptocurrencies, said Ravi Menon, managing director of central bank the Monetary of Singapore.",
        "“If a crypto hub is about experimenting with programmable money, applying digital assets for use cases or tokenizing financial assets to increase efficiency and reduce risk in financial transactions, yes, we want to be a crypto hub,” said Menon in his opening address at the Singapore Fintech Festival 2022 on Thursday.",
        "Tokenizing a financial asset involves converting its ownership rights into digital tokens.",
        "DBS Bank is testing out Singapore’s first digital money live pilot for government vouchers, enabling merchants to program and self-execute the distribution and usage.",
        "“But if it is about trading and speculating in cryptocurrencies, that is not the kind of crypto hub we want to be,” said Menon. ",

        "Singapore has ambitions to become a global crypto hub, but has been cracking down on the industry after many retail investors lost their life savings to crypto trading. The city-state has repeatedly warned that cryptocurrency trading is “highly risky and not suitable for the general public” due to its volatile and speculative nature. It even banned crypto advertising in public areas and on social media in January 2021 and proposed new measures to protect retail investors recently following the $60 billion collapse of Terra’s Luna. ",
        "Still, Singapore has openly shown its approval for blockchain technology and has embarked on various projects. Those include Project Ubin, which successfully completed its experiment using blockchain for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities.",
        "Another is Project Guardian, which recently completed its first industry pilot that involved DBS Bank, JPMorgan and SBI Digital Assets Holdings conducting transactions in tokenized foreign exchange and government bonds. ",
        "“Project Guardian’s first pilot has demonstrated the potential for reducing risks in executing trades,” said Menon. ",
        "“These projects strive to increase efficiency in the product value chains, lower efficient issuance and servicing costs and improve transparency and accessibility. We believe Project Guardian can help pave the way for the next evolution of financial markets in Singapore,” said Menon.",
        "MAS will be following up with two new industry pilots — one with Standard Chartered Bank leading an initiative to explore the issuance of tokens linked to trade finance assets and the other with HSBC and UOB working alongside Marketnode to enable native digital issuance of wealth management products.",
        "In his speech, Menon also announced that the MAS will be launching Project Ubin+, a global initiative on the cross-border exchange and settlement of foreign currency transactions using wholesale central bank digital currencies. ",
        "Project Ubin was first started in 2016 and is the launch pad for the development of Partior, a blockchain-based payments clearing and settlement network by DBS Bank, JPMorgan and Temasek."

        "Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is getting closer to figuring out the identity of a hacker that orchestrated a $570 million hack on its BNB blockchain, CEO Changpeng Zhao told CNBC Monday.",
        "After getting some tips from law enforcement on who the hacker might be, Binance is now “narrowing down” the person or persons behind the attack, Zhao said in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”",
        "The attack in question saw a so-called cross-chain bridge targeted, allowing an as-yet unknown hacker or hackers to withdraw 2 million of Binance’s BNB tokens worth around $570 million at the time.",
        "More than $1 billion has been lost to breaches on cross-chain bridges so far this year, tools that facilitate the swift transfer of tokens from one blockchain platform to another, according to Chainalysis data.",
        "Popular in the world of “DeFi,” or decentralized finance, bridges have become a hot target for criminals due to faults in their underlying code.",
        "“We’re still actually chasing … helping [authorities] to chase the bad players, working with law enforcement around the globe,” Zhao said. “Working with law enforcement is one of the ways that we can try to make the space safe.”",
        "“Actually, in this particular instant, law enforcement gave us some tips of who they think it might be. So we’re actually narrowing down.”",
        "Binance intervened to limit the damage of the attack, pausing activity on its BNB Chain blockchain network after coordinating with network validators — individuals and entities that sign off on transaction approvals — to enact an upgrade.",
        "Zhao, who is commonly referred to as “CZ” online, said this meant BNB Chain was able to prevent most of the targeted funds from being taken by the hacker.",
        "“The blockchain was able to freeze about 80% to 90% of it, so the actual loss of it was much smaller,” he said.",
        "The “vast majority of the funds remain under control,” Binance’s BNB Chain said in a statement at the time of the hack. About $100 million was unrecoverable, BNB Chain added.",
        "The BNB Chain, originally known as Binance Chain, was first developed by Binance in 2019. Like other blockchains, it features a native token, called BNB, that can be traded or used in games and other applications."
