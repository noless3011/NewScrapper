        "Sanctioned entities, like those linked to North Korean hacking groups and U.S.-designated terrorist organizations such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, continue to rely on cryptocurrency for fundraising, according to a new report from Chainalysis.",
        "The American blockchain analysis firm’s “2024 Crypto Crime Report” found that $24.2 billion of illicit cryptocurrency was transferred in 2023, based on already identified illicit crypto wallets. Chainalysis retroactively updates its yearly crypto figures when new illicit wallets come to light.",
        "While last year’s numbers currently represent a drop from the previous year, Chainalysis noted a much higher proportion of the funds were attributed to sanctioned or terrorist-linked recipients, accounting for about 61.5% of total illicit transaction volume in 2023.",
        "“Actors subject to sanctions are often cut off from international traditional financial systems, and crypto can become an attempted alternative mechanism to store, send, and receive funds,” Andrew Fierman, head of sanctions strategy at Chainalysis, told CNBC on Thursday.",
        "Entities like the crypto “mixer” Tornado Cash and Garantex took the lion’s share of illicit funds in 2023. Tornado Cash was sanctioned in August 2022 for its role in laundering crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus Group. Russian-based exchange Garantex was sanctioned in April 2022 for its affiliation with illicit actors, including ransomware groups.",
        "Crypto mixers are software that obscure the history and origin of digital assets sent through them.",
        "The amount of crypto transferred to sanctioned entities has climbed in recent years in tandem with a greater share of new trade restrictions specifying crypto wallets.",
        "In 2023, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions list imposed a total of 18 new sanctions on individuals and entities, including their associated crypto wallets.",
        "At least nine of the new sanctions were against individuals and entities across China and Latin America for their alleged role in fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking. Meanwhile, five of the sanctions targeted entities deemed to have violated sanctions on North Korea.",
        "The top crypto recipient added to the sanctions list last year was Sinbad.io — a bitcoin mixer that was shut down in November of 2023 — which received $665.4 million in crypto from the Lazarus Group.",
        "Still, sanctions have shown the ability to slow the flow of crypto funds to their targets. Tornado Cash’s monthly inflows dropped by as much as 93% immediately following its placement on the U.S. list, according to Chainalysis. Though the firm noted inflows slowly rebounded from that low in the following months.",
        "Of sanctioned countries, Iran was a major recipient of illicit funds, with 73.3% of inflows coming from international mainstream exchanges indicating the services might be used to subvert sanctions, Chainalysis said.",
        "Illicit crypto volume identified by Chainalysis as terrorist financing accounted for a much smaller proportion than that of transactions to sanctioned entities in 2022.",
        "Chainalysis argued that, contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrency is not an effective tool for terrorism funding because blockchain allows funds to be traced at a level of detail not typically available in traditional finance.",
        "“The transparent nature of cryptocurrency combined with blockchain analytics provides an invaluable forensic tool that empowers governments to identify, trace, and disrupt the flow of funds – something that isn’t possible with other forms of value transfer, especially cash,” said Chanalysis’s Fierman.",
        "Despite these obstacles, terrorist organizations have continued to try to utilize cryptocurrencies for fundraising, deploying intricate networks of crypto exchanges and service providers, the report said.",
        "Last year, tracing efforts resulted in the seizure of millions in funds. In one such case, Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing said in June that it had seized $1.7 million of cryptocurrency linked to Hezbollah and Iran’s Quds Force through a Syria-based financial facilitator named Tawfiq Muhammad Said Al-Law.",
        "Chainalysis’s report outlined how Al-Law’s relied on a network of legitimate mainstream exchanges and an extensive network of wallets for cryptocurrency transactions to aid Hezbollah’s cryptocurrency financing infrastructure.",
        "The wallets linked to Al-Law collectively received funds ranging from millions to over $1 billion in cryptocurrency, involving up to tens of thousands of transfers.",
        "Meanwhile, entities and individuals linked to designated terrorist groups, such as ISIS and Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, have continued to solicit cryptocurrency through crowdfunding efforts.",
        "However, according to Fierman, efforts in tracing and seizing these funds have become increasingly sophisticated.",
        "“The data also shows that as crypto adoption by illicit actors continues to grow, sanctioning bodies like OFAC are continually evolving their methods to identify these actors and disrupt their activities,” he added.",
        "In another example cited in the Chainalysis report, Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced their decision to stop accepting crypto donations last year due to the risk of potential donors being traced. This followed reports that Hamas had received large amounts of cryptocurrencies in the lead up to its attack on Israel on Oct. 7.",
        "Although terrorism financing is a “small share” of illicit crypto activity, it still presents an “ever-present concern” in the ecosystem, said Chainalysis in its report.",
        "Strengthened public and private partnerships are needed to help bolster these efforts and to decipher between illicit actors and funds sent to conflict zones for legitimate causes, it added."

        "LONDON — A former British finance minister on Wednesday joined cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as a global advisor, beefing up the company’s regulatory bargaining power at a time when it faces severe scrutiny stateside.",
        "Coinbase announced that George Osborne, who served as Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer from 2010 to 2016, will join the company on its global advisory council.",
        "He’ll join the likes of Mark Esper, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense and Patrick Toomey (R-PA) on the council, which is in place to “advise Coinbase on our global strategy as we grow our reach around the world.”",
        "Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, said the company was “pleased to have George join our council at an exciting time for us in the U.K. and globally.”",
        "“George brings with him a wealth of experience in business, journalism and government. We look forward to relying on his insights and experiences as we grow Coinbase around the world,” Shirzard added.",
        "Osborne will serve in an advisory capacity at Coinbase, helping connect the company with politicians and regulators to help further the cause of forming crypto-friendly regulations.",
        "While chancellor of the exchequer, Osborne launched a slew of austerity policies aimed at reducing the budget deficit, including freezing child benefits, reducing housing benefits, and implementing a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers. He also tried to stimulate business activity by cutting corporation tax.",
        "Osborne was temporarily editor-in-chief at London’s Evening Standard newspaper after completing his tenure as Britain’s finance minister. He is currently a partner at Robey Warshaw LLP, a boutique investment bank.",
        "“There’s a huge amount of exciting innovation in finance right now,” Osborne said. “Blockchains are transforming financial markets and online transactions.”",
        "“Coinbase is at the frontier of these developments. I look forward to working with the team there as they build a new future in financial services,” Osborne continued.",
        "Suggestions of a growing relationship between Osborne and Coinbase first emerged last year, when Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong spoke onstage in a fireside moderated by Osborne at a fintech event in London.",
        "Osborne subsequently spoke with Coinbase’s chief financial officer, Alesia Haas, at a fireside chat in the Belvedere Hotel during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
        "It comes as Coinbase has made something of a land grab across Europe, expanding in multiple countries over the last few months with new licenses in place. The company was granted a virtual asset service provider license in France last month, paving the way for expansion of its services there. It has also recently secured licenses in Spain, Singapore, and Bermuda.",
        "Coinbase is currently facing a harsh regulatory crackdown in the U.S. where the Securities and Exchange Commission has accused the company of violating securities laws. Coinbase denies the allegations.",
        "Last year, Coinbase chief Armstrong appeared on stage with Osborne at the Innovate Finance Global Summit conference in London. At the event, Armstrong said he was open to investing more abroad, including relocating from the U.S. to the U.K. or elsewhere if the regulatory pressure on crypto companies continues.",
        "“I think if a number of years go by where we don’t see regulatory clarity around us ... we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world. Anything including, you know, relocating,” Armstrong told Osborne.",
        "He told CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal at the time that Coinbase was “looking at other markets” as it considers its position from a regulatory standpoint.",
        "Armstrong did later clarify in an interview with CNBC’s Dan Murphy that Coinbase had no formal plans to relocate from its U.S. headquarters in San Francisco. “Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas,” Armstrong said. “We’re always going to have a U.S. presence ... But the U.S. is a little bit behind right now.”"

This is different from a wholesale CBDC which is used exclusively by central banks, commercial banks and other financial institutions to settle large-value interbank transactions.",
        "The International Monetary Fund has said that CBDCs are “a safe and low-cost alternative” to cash, with approximately 60% of countries in the world exploring CBDCs. However, only 11 countries have adopted them, with an additional 53 in advanced planning stages and 46 researching the topic as of June, according to data from the Atlantic Council.",

But a lot of the central banks nowadays have gotten very innovative because they are working very closely with private companies like ours, to create that ecosystem,” said the Asia-Pacific lead.",

        "“Since 2016, the MAS has conducted many experiments with other central banks and the financial industry to explore the use of wholesale CBDCs on distributed ledgers to facilitate real time cross border payments and settlements,” said Menon, referring to the database spread across a network that is accessible from several geographical locations.",
        "One such pilot project is Project Ubin, which was started in 2016 to explore the use of blockchain and digital ledger technology for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities.",
        "Project Ubin was successfully completed in 2021 after five phases of experimentation. Some of the partners included Singapore’s largest bank DBS and sovereign wealth fund Temasek.",
        "MAS announced Ubin+ in November last year to advance cross-border connectivity with wholesale CBDCs through collaborations with international partners.",
        "During the pilot, Singapore’s central bank will partner with local banks to test the use of wholesale CBDCs to facilitate domestic payments, said Menon.",
        "Banks will issue tokenized bank liabilities in the form of claims in balance sheets. Retail customers can then use the tokenized bank liabilities in transactions with merchants, who will then credit these bank liabilities with their respective banks. Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital form of an asset on a blockchain.",
        "The CBDC will then be automatically transferred to the merchant as a form of payment during the transaction.",
        "“So clearing and settlement occurs in a single step on the same infrastructure, unlike the current system in which clearing and settlement take place on different systems and settlement occurs with a lag,” said Menon.",
        "On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director urged the public sector to keep preparing to deploy CBDCs and related payment platforms in the future.",
        "“We have not yet reached land. There is so much more space for innovation and so much uncertainty over use-cases,” said Kristalina Georgieva.",
        "Menon is set to retire from public service and step down as managing director of MAS on Dec. 31 since being appointed to the position in 2011. He will be succeeded by Chia Der Jiun who previously spent 18 years at MAS."

        "SINGAPORE — Central bank digital currencies have the potential to replace cash, but adoption could take time, said Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday.",
        "“CBDCs can replace cash which is costly to distribute in island economies,” she said Wednesday at the Singapore FinTech Festival. “They can offer resilience in more advanced economies. And they can improve financial inclusion where few hold bank accounts.”",
        "CBDCs are the digital form of a country’s fiat currency, which are regulated by the country’s central bank. They are powered by blockchain technology, allowing central banks to channel government payments directly to households.",
        "“CBDCs would offer a safe and low-cost alternative [to cash]. They would also offer a bridge to go between private monies and a yardstick to measure their value, just like cash today which we can withdraw from our banks,” the IMF chief said.",
        "The IMF has said that more than 100 countries are exploring CBDCs – or approximately 60% of countries in the world.",
        "“The level of global interest in CBDCs is unprecedented. Several central banks have already launched pilots or even issued a CBDC,” the IMF said in a September report.",
        "According to a 2022 survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, of the 86 central banks surveyed, 93% said they were exploring CBDCs, while 58% said they were likely to or may possibly issue a retail CBDC in either the short or medium term.",
        "But as of June, only 11 countries have adopted CBDCs, with an additional 53 in advanced planning stages and 46 researching the topic, according to data from the Atlantic Council.",
        "Referring to a 2018 speech by her predecessor Christine Lagarde, when the former IMF chief encouraged policymakers to follow the “winds of change” and explore the use of CBDCs, Georgieva said: “Five years on, I’m here to provide an update on that voyage.”",
        "“First, countries did set sail. Many are investigating CBDCs and are developing regulation to guide digital money developments,” said Georgieva referring to the speech.",
        "On Wednesday, the fund launched a CBDC handbook as a reference guide for policymakers around the world. Georgieva said many countries are investigating CBDCs and developing regulation to guide digital money developments.",
        "“Second, we have not yet reached land. There is so much more space for innovation and so much uncertainty over use-cases,” Georgieva told an audience which included industry experts, investors and journalists.",
        "“In some countries the case seems dim today, but even they should remain open to potentially deploy CBDCs tomorrow. Why?” said Georgieva. “This is not the time to turn back.”",
        "“The public sector should keep preparing to deploy CBDCs and related payment platforms in the future. Fourth, these platforms should be designed from the start to facilitate cross-border payments, including with CBDCs,” the managing director said.",
        "Countries that have issued retail CBDC include the Bahamas, Jamaica and Nigeria.",
        "Singapore’s Monetary Authority of Singapore has said that cash is “generally incompatible” with the digital economy. In a 2021 report, the country’s central bank said the demand for cash as a means of payment is set to decline further.",
        "According to the BIS, using CBDCs for cross-border payments could lower the costs of obtaining, storing and spending foreign currency, depending on design and regulations.",
        "Georgieva also said that artificial intelligence “could amplify some of the benefits of CBDCs” by providing accurate credit scoring and personalized support.",
        "Demand for generative AI has boomed following the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November last year, which was estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users within two months after launch.",
        "“It could improve financial inclusion by providing rapid, accurate credit scoring based on various data. It could provide personalized support to people with low financial literacy,” said Georgieva.",
        "“To be sure, we need to protect personal privacy and data security, and avoid embedded biases so we don’t perpetuate inequality but aim to reduce it. Managed prudently, AI could help,” she added."

        "The cost of decarbonizing the shipping industry will have a knock-on effect on consumers, according to a CEO in the maritime industry.",
        "“There will be an inflationary impact coming from [the] decarbonization of shipping … there is no question of it,” Bertrand Chen, CEO of the Global Shipping Business Network, told CNBC’s East Tech West conference in the Nansha district of Guangzhou, China.",
        "New European rules that effectively tax shipping lines for their emissions would push up costs, Chen added.",
        "“The EU government is imposing this cost to the shipping line … But now what that means is the shipping has to take action to decarbonize and naturally that will impact all the consumer. So, I think it’s just a trade-off people will have to live with.”",
        "The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) is set to be extended to the shipping industry starting in January 2024, meaning that large ships entering EU ports will be charged for their carbon dioxide emissions.",
        "The ETS currently covers sectors like mining and aviation and is designed to put a cost on carbon for the region’s most polluting industries.",
        "Chen described the EU initiative as “a natural action that will lead to some interesting effects.”",
        "“Suddenly you need to be able to prove that indeed you’re taking the right action [to decarbonize] and you can see in the shipping line industry some people … are investing in the methanol ships, who are setting up investment funds to go buy those resources, because it’s really hard to buy the alternative fuel. Some are more passive [and] are waiting to see,” he said.",
        "Shipping line Maersk\nlaunched its first vessel with an engine fueled by green methanol in September, but analysts expressed concerns about supply of the alternative fuel.",
        "Shoppers may be willing to spend more on items that have been shipped or produced in a way that “doesn’t create greenhouse gas,” but they will require proof because of the high risk of greenwashing, Chen said.",
        "“Everyone will have to become decarbonized, it’s a question of time. And in that world, what you need is to be able to prove to the end consumer that indeed the action you’re taking is right and that’s something that’s not easy to prove today,” he added.",
        "Using the blockchain to store and give access to legal and financial documents could help the shipping industry provide that proof, Chen said.",
        "Maritime nations agreed in July to reduce emissions “by or around 2050,” during a meeting of the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization.",

        "“Binance accounts around the world are not affected. Where available, users can also shop with crypto and send crypto using Binance Pay, a contactless, borderless and secure cryptocurrency payment technology designed by Binance,” the company added.",
        "Mastercard confirmed that it is ending the partnership, with a spokesperson telling CNBC that, from Sept. 22, four pilot Binance co-branded Mastercard card programs the company had with Binance in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bahrain “will no longer be in use.”",
        "“This provides cardholders with a wind-down period to convert any holdings in their Binance wallet,” the Mastercard spokesperson said. “There is no impact on any other crypto card program.”",

        "It’s a sign of how crypto continues to face a broadly tepid response from the financial services industry.",

Last year, the company launched a product allowing banks to assess the risk of crime posed by crypto merchants, and started letting banks offer crypto trading.",
