Hong Kong police have restricted access to MEXC websites and are collaborating with the SFC to investigate further instances of fraudulent behavior.

The SFC’s notice highlights suspected virtual asset fraud involving BitForex, emphasizing that the exchange is neither licensed by the SFC nor has it applied for a license to operate a virtual asset trading platform in Hong Kong. Given the risks of dealing with unlicensed entities, investors are urged to exercise caution when engaging with unregistered Bitcoin platforms. In response to these concerns, the SFC has blocked access to BitForex’s web links and social media pages to reduce potential harm to investors.",

        "The court’s order prohibited Todd and his firms from registering with the CFTC and trading in any CFTC-regulated markets. Additionally, the court ordered Todd to pay a $3.9 million disgorgement and a $11.7 million civil monetary penalty, effectively resolving the CFTC’s enforcement action against the entities."

Through its defense lawyer, James Filan, the company filed a detailed motion disputing the SEC’s penalty demands, suggesting a much lower penalty of $10 million instead.The opposition emphasizes that the SEC’s proposed penalties are not in line with the actual circumstances of the case. Ripple contends that no allegations or findings of reckless behavior or fraudulent activity would justify such severe financial penalties. Additionally, Ripple asserts that its XRP sales were conducted transparently and with knowledgeable institutional investors who were fully informed about the transactions.Ripple highlights its significant legal victories throughout the litigation, suggesting that the SEC’s penalty demands are inconsistent with the court’s findings. The company argues that the SEC’s request is evidence of ongoing intimidation against the crypto industry in the United States, particularly considering the lack of allegations of recklessness or fraud in the case.Ripple proposes a much lower penalty of $10 million, which is more appropriate given the nature of the alleged violations and the company’s conduct. Ripple contends that this amount would adequately serve the legal interests without being disproportionately punitive.According to analysts, the case is expected to reach a final judgment around September. The court will decide on penalties, and Ripple expresses confidence in the judge’s fair approach to the final remedies phase."

Through its defense lawyer, James Filan, the company filed a detailed motion disputing the SEC’s penalty demands, suggesting a much lower penalty of $10 million instead.The opposition emphasizes that the SEC’s proposed penalties are not in line with the actual circumstances of the case. Ripple contends that no allegations or findings of reckless behavior or fraudulent activity would justify such severe financial penalties. Additionally, Ripple asserts that its XRP sales were conducted transparently and with knowledgeable institutional investors who were fully informed about the transactions.Ripple highlights its significant legal victories throughout the litigation, suggesting that the SEC’s penalty demands are inconsistent with the court’s findings. The company argues that the SEC’s request is evidence of ongoing intimidation against the crypto industry in the United States, particularly considering the lack of allegations of recklessness or fraud in the case.Ripple proposes a much lower penalty of $10 million, which is more appropriate given the nature of the alleged violations and the company’s conduct. Ripple contends that this amount would adequately serve the legal interests without being disproportionately punitive.According to analysts, the case is expected to reach a final judgment around September. The court will decide on penalties, and Ripple expresses confidence in the judge’s fair approach to the final remedies phase."

This decrease resulted from soft demand and a price drop in computing power throughout 2023.",
        "Despite the revenue decline, mining revenue amounted to $34 million in 2023, slightly higher than the $32.5 million recorded in 2022, according to the company’s report."

        "Instead, BTC’s price has pulled back considerably since traders set an all-time high (ATH) at $73,750 on March 14. Bitcoin’s recent correction lowered prices to the $60,000 support level, leading to a massive decline in investor confidence. Some analysts blamed the recent price drop on miners selling off their tokens before the halving event.",

Early investors have already accrued 300% returns, and the party is just getting started as some analysts believe prices will surge by over 10,000% before the year ends.",

        "QUBE is a deflationary ERC20 coin with a 1.5 billion supply limit and burn taxes that further cut down the supply. The small token supply encourages long-term price growth as its market capitalization grows. QUBE would be worth more than a dollar once its market cap reaches around $1.5 billion, a long way from the $0.028 it sold for during the final stage of its presale.",
        "InQubeta plans to revolutionize how AI startups engage with their communities and raise capital by creating an NFT marketplace where investment opportunities get tokenized into non-fungible tokens. Anyone can easily invest in startups they believe in on the ecosystem by buying their NFTs with QUBE. Fractionalization allows investors to invest in a way that suits their budgets by allowing them to acquire portions of tokens they are interested in.",
        "InQubeta uses a democratic governance model to ensure those who invest in it have a say regarding its daily operations and plans for the future. The size of a user’s QUBE bag determines how much weight their vote carries when ideas are proposed and discussed.",
        "The artificial intelligence industry is poised for substantial growth as investments in the sector grow considerably, and more than $1.5 trillion will flow into companies like InQubeta in the next several years. Even a fraction of these funds coming InQubeta’s way would increase QUBE prices exponentially. It’s one of the best altcoins to invest in.",
        "Visit InQubeta Website",
        "Some Bitcoin investors remain optimistic that a reversal will occur before the 19th as bolder investors open up long positions in anticipation of the supply shock the milestone will cause by reducing miner rewards by half.",
        "Miners are concerned about the halving not bringing the tremendous growth many analysts have predicted, and they are being blamed for BTC’s recent price drop as some opt to sell their remaining BTC. However, the good news is that prices have held steady above $60,000 despite the massive sell-offs.",

        "Is The Bull Market Over Before The Bitcoin Halving? Glassnode Report",
        "Bitcoin’s latest price dip to under $60,000 has raised questions as to whether the asset’s spectacular bull run this year could be ending earlier than expected.",
        "Lead Glassnode analyst James Check, however, says bull have very little to worry about.",
        "Bitcoin’s Pullback: Dip Or Doom?",
        "In a video analysis posted on Friday, Check reviewed various on-chain metrics concerning short-term Bitcoin holders, who first acquired their coins less than five months prior.",
        "Firstly, Bitcoin’s short-term holder MVRV ratio is now re-approaching 1.0, meaning its unrealized profit and loss have reached a break-even point. This level can serve as support after a bull market dip, but also major resistance during bear markets when most Bitcoin holders are underwater.",
        "“Little undercuts are good,” said Check. “In 2023 we had several of these retests. If we assume this is a resilient uptrend, we should expect the short-term holder cost basis to hold, somewhere in that $58,000 to $59,000 region. “",
        "Similarly, short-term holder SOPR has also recently dipped beneath 1.0, meaning that short-term holders are now beginning to realize more losses than profits. Should SOPR fall significantly under this level without resurfacing, it may be a sign of a sustained bear market to come.",
        "As of this week, short-term holders realized losses have spiked substantially – a sign that new buyers were panic selling at a loss amid news of rising conflict between Iran and Israel.",
        "“This is essentially what you do want to see, as a contrarian,” Check added. “As a contrarian, you kind of want to see people doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.”",
        "Days ago, Check noted that Bitcoin’s price may transition into being “top-heavy” if its price moves below $58,800. The asset trades for $64,000 at writing time.",
        "Bitcoin’s Long Term Momentum",
        "Other metrics like the AVIV momentum indicator suggest that Bitcoin price momentum remains positive on longer time frames, merely experiencing a cooldown on the 30-day timeframe for a “proper reset.”",
        "The AVIV Momentum indicator also remains in positive territory, with all timeframes hitting higher altitudes on each successive peak.",

        "",
        "Regarding the Bitcoin halving itself, Check believes its financial impact may be overhyped. Compared to Bitcoin futures volume, spot volume, and ETF trade volume, the daily BTC issued to miners is a tiny fraction of the market.",
        "“The size of the halving, is a narrative game more than it is in terms of size now… it’s just very very small,” he said."

And while initiatives have been taking place to educate Americans about the traditional finance sector, opportunities around crypto education are also being presented this month.",
        "Crypto Education Becomes Important In The U.S.",

        "The upcoming Bitcoin Halving event has also sparked increasing interest in Bitcoin (BTC).",
        "Given the rising popularity of digital assets in the U.S., industry experts believe that education about cryptocurrency has become increasingly necessary.",

        "Kendra Cole, Co-founder and CEO of Sparrow Finance, told Cryptonews that the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has pushed digital assets to the mainstream.",
        "Cole believes that individuals—particularly women and children—must be presented with better educational opportunities regarding Bitcoin adoption.",
        "“The impetus for women to get involved in Bitcoin now is to build stronger bonds through shared experiences and interests,” said Cole. “We know that women are oftentimes the chief financial officers of the home, making the majority of the financial and gifting decisions. Sparrow Finance aims to provide the tools to do this through Bitcoin education.”",
        "During Financial Capability Month, Cole shared that Sparrow Finance participated in Chicago’s Ultimate Baby Shower. This was a community-wide event for parents to discuss financial education.",
        "“During this gathering, we met with new parents to provide information about how women can get involved with digital assets,” she said. “We also discussed ways for women to leverage Bitcoin to build connections with loved ones.”",
        "Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is also focused on crypto education this month. A Coinbase spokesperson told Cryptonews that 87% of Americans want to update the financial system.",
        "“The top drivers of this discontent are frustration over fees and speed,” the spokesperson noted. “The current system costs regular Americans too much, takes too long, and gets you less for your money over time.”",
        "In order to shed light on this, Coinbase released a commercial this week explaining the Bitcoin halving event to the masses.",

        "For example, Blackrock’s educational video on the Bitcoin halving notes, “To ensure no more than 21 million coins enter circulation, every four years there is what is known as a halving event, where the amount of bitcoin issued to miners for completing each block is cut in half.”",
        "Crypto Education Increases Across The World",
        "While crypto education is becoming increasingly important in the U.S., a number of initiatives are being launched throughout the world as well.",

        "Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget, told Cryptonews that the purpose of this undertaking is to support young talent while establishing a blockchain-friendly educational environment.",
        "“Since the launch of Blockchain4Youth in May 2023, the program has been hosting campus roadshows around the world to educate global youth about blockchain knowledge,” said Chen. “This month, Bitget hosted a Blockchain4Youth event at Ton Duc Thang University in Ho Chi Minh City as part of the HUB FORUM 2024 event, gathering over 1,000 students from various universities in Ho Chi Minh City.”",
        "Chen pointed out that hosting events like Blockchain4Youth has become a necessity, noting that a recent Bitget study found that Millennials and GenZ’s are likely to become the main drivers of crypto adoption.",
        "Chen added that Bitget has other educational crypto events planned in the Philippines and Japan later this month as well.",
        "“Cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide financial access to people who are underserved or excluded by traditional banking systems,” she said. “Education can help bridge the gap by teaching people how to use cryptocurrencies and access financial services in a decentralized manner.”",
        "Stablecoin issuer Tether also recently established an educational initiative in the Middle East.",
        "The USDT issuer partnered with digital asset infrastructure provider Fuze to create digital asset awareness for businesses and individuals across Turkey, the Middle East, and North Africa.",

        "For instance, Cole believes that the biggest challenge involved with digital asset education is overcoming the knowledge and confidence gap.",
        "“This gap disproportionately affects women, who juggle multifaceted responsibilities —like their career, family, and finances —all while navigating the complexities of digital assets,” she said. “Amidst all of this, finding time to delve into digital asset education can seem daunting.”",
        "To overcome these obstacles, Cole views the power of community and in-person events as ways to help women and families understand cryptocurrency.",
        "While this may be the case, Chen believes the crypto industry’s fast-paced nature is problematic for most individuals.",
        "“The cryptocurrency industry may see new innovations emerge every month, week, or even daily,” she said. “Only learners with a high level of curiosity and initiative are able to keep up with the crypto industry’s pace effectively.”",
        "Given this, Chen noted that individuals wanting to learn about digital assets shouldn’t rely solely on articles, videos, books, or the internet to grasp the industry fully."

        "Peter Brandt Bitcoin Price Prediction Entails Three Phases",
        "The seasoned trader analyzed Bitcoin’s market behavior in a thread on X, where he classified the asset into three phases: Hump-Slump, Bump-Rump, and Pump-Dump.",

        "His deduction of a potential major Bitcoin price move comes amid a bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market, largely due to the news of the geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran.",
        "Brandt’s analysis offers a potentially deeper perspective on the recent trajectory of BTC’s price, however.",
        "For instance, when Israel launched a retaliatory attack on Iran overnight, Bitcoin briefly dipped to $59K from its prior price of $63.4K before recovering to $65K. This rapid shift in trend has also fueled gains in other cryptocurrencies, indicating the possibility of an altcoin rally.",

In addition, the Foundation is preparing to release version 0.13.1, which will move from the costly call data method to the more economical blobs transaction type, with the goal of significantly reducing fees.

In addition, a new hash system will be deployed to increase the protocol’s transaction capacity.",

        "However, as we looked through different sections of the website, we did find that it supports both autonomous and manual trading systems.",
        "The autonomous trading system makes use of an AI trading bot. This robot is reportedly powered by algorithms and machine learning, capable of finding investment opportunities and executing trades on an investor’s behalf.",
        "Another element of autonomous trading is its settings. Per the website, users are free to make adjustments to the robot before turning it on to find good investment opportunities. However, the names of these settings are not mentioned.",
        "This system also reportedly offers AI-powered analytics and forecasting tools, allowing investors to enhance their market knowledge. The same tool is reportedly used by Immediate Folex 365’s manual trading system, which offers users robust trading signals.",
        "A user-friendly interface supports these features, reportedly allowing investors to make better decisions quickly and without having to deal with complex buttons and charts. Access to real-time market information is also discussed in the content, which indicates that investors may get access to the latest news in the form of tweets or articles to make better market decisions.",
        "Per Immediate 3000 Folex, these features are also shielded using a robust security protocol.",
        "This gives only a rough idea of how the site might work. The real information about its modus operandi may only be found after talking to the customer support team.",
        "Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.",
        "Immediate 3000 Folex Features",
        "The following are the benefits that the website has highlighted as its features:",
        "According to the website, users will get access to comprehensive market analytical tools that will provide them with a simple report highlighting the market conditions. The comprehensive market knowledge may consist of charts, graphs, or summaries that focus on the current market conditions.",
        "“Enjoy a seamless trading experience with an intuitive platform,” claims Immediate 3000 Folex, using these words to highlight its purportedly simple user interface. It is likely that users will have access to minimalistic tools that let them trade easily.",
        "The website claims that users will have access to real-time market information. Although there is no information about how this information is provided, a handful of third-party reviews have highlighted that educational resources such as videos, articles, blogs, and tweets are available.",
        "Immediate 3000 Folex discusses advanced security protocols designed to safeguard a user’s assets and holdings. However, it is not clear whether these features include encryption or special authorization access since no actual information is provided highlighting these details.",
        "Immediate Folex 365 claims to provide complete customer support. Describing this support as agile. the platform claims that users will have access to all the recommendations and assistance when they need it. However, there is no information about how people can get help. Some say that telephony and email are options. But the only information we could see on the website was the contact form, and even that didn’t give us the desired results.",
        "Immediate 3000 Folex states that it will provide advanced technologies to users. These features are reportedly integrated into the platform to enhance a trader’s investing capabilities and “potential profitability”.",
        "Immediate 3000 Folex Fees",
        "Investors won’t find anything related to fee details on the platform. The term “fees” is used only twice on the website to highlight the fact that there are no withdrawal fees. No information about the transaction fee, deposit fee, or commission is provided, which indicates that users may have to pay them. Since information on how these are charged is not available, we recommend talking to the individual service-providing firm during the sign-up process.",
        "Immediate 3000 Folex Minimum Deposit",
        "Investors must deposit at least $250 to access any of the features the website has highlighted. The deposit method is varied. Options available include PayPal, wire transfer, and credit card. Cryptocurrency is not mentioned as a deposit option. Therefore, investors must inquire about the deposit charge before proceeding.",
        "Is Immediate 3000 Folex a Scam?",
        "One key question that many might ask about Immediate 3000 Folex is, is it a scam? The lack of information, only surface-level discussions of its features, and no details about its founders or fees may make it seem that way.",
        "However, the answer to this question is a lot more complex than one makes it out to be. For one, the only upselling the platform has done via its content is of its features. It has only stated that they are very effective without giving us any actual number. It doesn’t make any claims about the accuracy rate of its AI crypto trading bot, nor does it praise the efficacy of its manual trading features.",
        "That being said, it has stated that it serves upwards of 14.5k customers and 9325 investors, details that match similar platforms we have covered before. It being active on 440 servers also looks like marketing-focused information since no other detail has been provided.",
        "On the other hand, navigating the website is as simple as Immediate 3000 Folex claims. We didn’t find any issues when going through the sign-up option, and the content provided is clear enough for us to conclude that it is easy to analyze the website’s content.",
        "So, for every negative aspect of the platform, there is a positive. However, that still doesn’t change the fact that the site is very opaque about providing substantial details. Such a lack of concern about providing robust information is concerning because people are now looking for a transparent trading site.",
        "Therefore, it is not clear whether this platform is a scam or a legitimate trading platform.",
        "How to Use Immediate 3000 Folex?",
        "Here are the steps to start using Immediate 3000 Folex:",
        "Users must first visit the official Immediate 3000 Folex website. Once there, they must analyze the content before entering key information to start the sign-up process. The platform assures us that it won’t take much time.",
        "",
        "Upon entering key details, investors may receive an email with a link to finalize account verification and deposit the required amount. To get started, they can use PayPal, wire transfer, or credit card to make a deposit of $250. A higher deposit may be needed if a deposit fee is charged.",
        "Once the account has been created, investors can commence trading. There is no mention of any testing tools, which means traders would have to learn on the go. A tutorial video may be available, but we also recommend that investors talk to the customer support team to learn about how the site works.",
        "How to Delete an Immediate 3000 Folex Account?",
        "The official website does not mention how to delete accounts. However, since most crypto trading platforms offer this facility, it might be possible through the dashboard itself. However, since Immediate 3000 Folex merely acts as a bridge between traders and trading firms, the process may be more cumbersome. Our recommendation would be to withdraw the amount from the account and leave it dormant. After a while, the account may be removed without any intervention.",
        "Have Any Celebrities Endorsed Immediate 3000 Folex?",
        "Immediate 3000 Folex doesn’t showcase any particular feature that makes it worthy of celebrity attention. Most of its highlighted features are simple, and most of its benefits are the ones we have covered before. Furthermore, the lack of founder-related details and online reviews show that the site is newly made, which means it hasn’t had time to attract celebrity interest.",
        "Who is the Founder of Immediate 3000 Folex?",
        "Immediate 3000 Folex was founded by a “team of experts who came together to overhaul the domain of trading and e-commerce.” That’s the extent of the information that the platform gives us about the founders of the website. No names were given, nor were any social media handles mentioned. However, there is an email address at the bottom of the screen that points out that the website is operated from Singapore. The rest of the key details are missing.",

        "The official Immediate 3000 Folex website hides many details about the official trading platform. No information is available about its makers, nor does the site say anything about its fee structure. The lack of depth about its features is another reason investors are concerned.",
        "However, amidst this info-lacked image, Immediate 3000 Folex doesn’t make any large claims and only highlights key points that are nothing more than marketing terms. In any case, the site mostly undersells itself by providing only small details. Therefore, it is recommended that investors exercise caution when trading on this website.",

        "Has Elon Musk endorsed Immediate 3000 Folex?",
        "Elon Musk has made no attempts to endorse Immediate 3000 Folex. The Tesla founder hasn’t supported any crypto trading platform. The only information we have is that he once held $2 billion worth of Bitcoin before selling a lot of it. Furthermore, to finance his Twitter acquisition, he secured $500 million from Binance."

        "Blockchain Engineer Salaries in Asia Drop by More Than 5%",
        "Salaries for blockchain engineers went down in 2023 due to tough times in the industry, like layoffs and companies not hiring as much.",
        "A recent NodeFlair report found that countries prioritizing startups and big tech experienced larger drops in blockchain engineer salaries. This highlights the impact of the overall economic and business climate on compensation levels in this field.",
        "In Singapore, blockchain engineer salaries decreased by 5.4% year-over-year, the report showed. On average, junior engineers received 6,750 SGD, while senior engineers earned about 10,000 SGD. Similarly, blockchain engineer salaries in India experienced a decline of nearly 6%.",
        "“In contrast to the preceding two years, during which technology salaries experienced substantial growth, there is now an overall decrease in salaries for various tech positions,” the firm wrote. However, the report acknowledged that compensation levels remain elevated compared to those seen in 2021.",
        "Multifaceted Downturn Behind Blockchain Salaries Squeeze",
        "The observed decline in salaries stems from a confluence of factors. Workforce reductions, hiring freezes triggered by regulatory actions against major crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, and FTX’s collapse last year significantly impacted compensation levels.",
        "Other factors include a decline in enthusiasm surrounding the metaverse and a period of prolonged crypto market decline. A general slowdown in hiring within the tech sector followed a period of pandemic-driven expansion, contributing to this trend. Further, venture capital funding scarcity in Southeast Asia exacerbated these challenges.",
        "In one example, Chinese Bitcoin mining machine manufacturer Bitmain was forced to delay salary payments due to cash flow challenges.",
        "AI \u0026 Data Science Skills In High Demand",
        "Software engineer salaries also fell at the same time, though the decline was less pronounced than that observed for blockchain engineers.",
        "According to NodeFlair, a key trend for the coming year is the sustained rise in demand for expertise in artificial intelligence and data science. The need for professionals skilled in machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis is anticipated to experience significant growth.",
        "Software engineers with a strong foundation in these areas will likely be highly sought-after. Companies will most likely strive to integrate AI technologies into their core functionalities.",
        "US Crypto Salaries Shine Brighter",
        "A comparative survey conducted in March revealed a trend of US-based crypto companies offering higher salaries across various job roles and experience levels when compared to their international counterparts. The survey indicated that US crypto salaries surpass those offered abroad by an average of 13%, with equity and token-based compensation packages being 30% more generous in the US."

        "SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Calls Out SAB 121, Claims Agency is “Scaring People Off”",
        "SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce criticized her own agency and its controversial staff accounting bulletin, SAB 121, during Tuesday remarks at the Practicing Law Institute’s 2024 SEC Speaks annual event, claiming the federal agency is “scaring people off.”",
        "A Weed In The SEC’s Secret Garden",
        "To kick off her speech, Peirce referred back to her 2019 SEC Speaks remarks where she compared the SEC to a secret garden where “the maze of staff guidance” may be “inconsistent with a plain reading of the rulebook.”",
        "“Nobody can challenge these diktats because they are not final agency action, but compliance is mandatory for an entity wishing to avoid SEC delays, denials, and enforcement and examination scrutiny,” Peirce said. “So everybody silently complies.”",
        "The SEC Commissioner further likened SAB 121, which mandates that publicly traded companies safeguarding crypto assets must list both assets and liabilities on their balance sheet, to a “weed” that has “sprung up in the secret garden.”",
        "“SAB 121 arguably does not protect investors,” Peirce said. “Its capital implications keep out of the business many banks and broker-dealers that have long years of custody experience.”",
        "SEC Commissioner Criticizes SAB 121",
        "Put together by the Office of the Chief Accountant (OCA), the SEC Commissioner went on to suggest the agency’s creation of SAB 121 could qualify as regulatory overreach, noting that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) ruled that the SEC should have submitted the accounting bulletin to Congress.",
        "“To make matters worse, OCA issued—orally at a conference of accountants—a multi-pronged framework for applying SAB 121 to broker-dealers,” Peirce continued. “The Commission has not published that framework or any subsequent staff efforts to clarify the framework’s scope, but many auditors and broker-dealers are treating it as binding.”",
        "The SEC is a regulatory agency with an enforcement division, not an enforcement agency. Why are we leading with enforcement in crypto?",
        "— Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) May 3, 2022",
        "",
        "Peirce expressed that the accounting bulletin has wide-ranging effects stemming from “driving broker-dealers to allocate significant capital to their crypto custody businesses” or simply avoiding “the business altogether.”",
        "Heavy Regulations Are “Scaring People Off”",
        "The SEC has long been scrutinized for its regulation-by-enforcement approach under Chair Gary Gensler, which has seen a number of key players across the crypto industry hit by litigation from the federal agency, including Kraken, Coinbase and Ripple.",
        "Peirce seemingly chided the agency’s direction under Gensler, claiming that the heavy-handed enforcement strategy may be doing more harm than good by “scaring people off” to having discussions about regulation.",
        "“The Commission’s announcement of a large ramp-up in its cyber-and crypto-enforcement unit, repeated assertions that the crypto industry is lawless, and treatment of cyber-incidents as fertile ground for enforcement actions add to these fears,” she continued.",
        "Peirce’s comments mark the latest development in the emerging world of crypto regulation and may signal greater overall dissatisfaction with the direction the SEC is heading in by its own employees."

        "Game Maker, K’NEX Winner, and Bitcoin Miner",
        "Barwikowski started young. At just 11 or 12, he began using a program called GameMaker and its scripting language. He made mini-games for his friends.",
        "He taught himself scripting languages, thinking about how it allows him to build “without any limits.”",
        "Interestingly, more than a decade ago, he won a nationwide contest for building with the construction toy system K’NEX, and:",
        "“I thought coding was really cool because I basically got unlimited K’NEX. I can just build whatever I want.”",
        "From then, Barwikowski moved into Web development and other areas.",
        "At one point, he even mined Bitcoin (BTC). At the time, one could still use a home computer. Barwikowski could “just leave my parents’ computer on and make money.”",
        "However, he was wiping his hard drives all the time, as he was in his hacking phase, “so I lost all that Bitcoin, but it’s fine.”",
        "After he moved from coding to entrepreneurship, he sold his first app at just 18.",
        "Creating Pixels",
        "Pixels, founded by Barwikowski, is a social casual Web3 game powered by the Ronin Network.",

        "At that time, there were just three people on the team, briefly competing with a product called Gather Town: “a combination of Zoom and an online game where you walk around and if you get close to people, it opens up video chats. It was spatial video,” he said.",
        "This is the technology he started selling quickly to large companies, including Apple, Uber, Rippling, and Twitter.",
        "However, while still working on that first app, its creator realized that it “wasn’t the best business.” The best use-case scenario for these virtual spaces is people gathering about once a week for an hour. And larger companies used it once a quarter with no other need for it.",
        "In 2021, however, Barwikowski noticed the massive popularity of Axie Infinity.",
        "Furthermore, as he studied economics, “the idea of building an economy ground up inside of the context of cryptocurrency made total sense to me.”",
        "And having a piece of tech in their hands they did not know what to do with, they started forming ideas of an avenue to move into.",
        "“We kind of turned that tech into Pixels,” Barwikowski said.",
        "Bottoms-up Growth Approach",
        "Barwikowski noted that Pixels may look simpler than it is. But there’s “a lot of depth” to it, he said.",
        "It’s 40% games and 60% everything else, said the founder, “and I think a lot of people in the space underestimate how much of the rest you need to build in addition to a game to make a successful Web3 game.”",
        "All these people are trying to make crazy complex web3 games with insane production when Monopoly Go is over there in web2 with $2b in revenue.",

        "Therefore, the team is very focused on what Barwikowski calls the Growth Engine, in line with their long-term plans and Pixels’ roadmap.",
        "Much of what they do is centered around the incentive design and “basically a new form of user acquisition.”",
        "Per the founder, Web3, if used properly, is an extremely powerful tool. It unlocks new types of ways for games to grow that don’t exist inside of Web2.",
        "“And what we’ve been experimenting with is basically what we call a bottoms-up growth approach,” he said.",
        "In Web2, games grow from performance marketing. They target a specific audience, spend money per user, and “then it just becomes a game of math for them.”",
        "They’ll decide if this game is successful or not right there. If it is, they’ll pour millions into advertising. And they need to raise millions to do that.",
        "In Web3, the team takes the complete opposite approach to the growth strategy, Barwikowski said. They aim to create the best incentive structures to “help our users help us grow.”",
        "That way, very little money is spent on user acquisition, for example, a few thousand dollars for giveaways.",

        "The Pixels team has a lot of respect for the Polygon team and the tech they built, Barwikowski said.",
        "But the hardest part of Web3 is user acquisition and distribution, he added. It’s difficult and costly.",
        "Ronin “had a level of distribution that doesn’t exist anywhere else inside of Web3 right now.” They’ve already done the hard work of onboarding millions of users onto their chain through Axie Infinity. “That is extremely valuable.”",
        "Per Luke Barwikowski,",
        "“I kind of viewed Ronin as almost like a new type of publisher in a way where they have access to a great dedicated user base.”",
        "People loved Axie, and even though Axie’s DAU was slightly down, there were still many users in that ecosystem “that could be resurrected.”",
        "This was “very true,” Barwikowski said, and many Pixels users now are from the Ronin ecosystem – the majority are (former) Axie Infinity players.",
        "Therefore, the growth began with the core Axie Infinity user base that Ronin had built out.",
        "Now, the game is getting very strong traction inside Southeast Asia and other markets.",
        "One more benefit of moving to Ronin, he said, is knowledge.",
        "There were many who tried giving the Pixel team advice about Web3 Gaming – but they themselves never launched a Web3 Game. They didn’t understand what actually comes with it.",
        "The Ronin Sky Mavis team knows what they are talking about, said Barwikowski, so their knowledge, mentorship, and guidance have been invaluable.",

Indeed, it has some tangible utility within the Bitgert ecosystem, noting that analysts believe that in the coming month, the price of this meme coin will surpass the mark of $0.01.",
        "Is there real magic in the potential of BEFE?",
        "Unlike the OG meme coins SHIB or DOGE in the market, BEFE has not come to be a speculative trend. Acting as a utility token of the Bitgert ecosystem, it has a crucial model to play. Whether it comes to transactions, powering dApps, or participating in the Bitgert governance mechanism, the funny beef has some inherent utility with a solid foundation.",

Analysts have noted that the price of the meme coin has been performing similarly to the success of the multiple phases of presale. Indeed, with all the eyes of the cryptosphere on the token, crypto coiners are closely observing the trends in the market.",
        "With the price of BEFE achieving new milestones, there is no time to sit back and speculate on the meme coin. Analysts suggest that Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is one strategy that can be beneficial for institutional investors. While mitigating the risk of BEFE’s meme coin angle, we must consider the meme coin’s utility potential over the long run.

        "",
        "",
        "The cryptocurrency market is filled with opportunities for astronomical returns. Bitcoin traded for just a few dollars in its early days and long-term holders have been able to make some great profits of multiple times their initial investment. Experts are on the lookout for the next major coin in its early days and Bitgert seems to be one that can be the next big thing in cryptocurrencies.",
        "What is Bitgert?",
        "The cryptocurrency market is filled with great opportunities but seems to be full of expensive transactions at low speeds. While some coins like Solana have been trying to fix this, a complete trusted fix is yet to be discovered. Bitgert’s native coin Brise seems to be the fix thanks to the near-zero gas fees paired up with the high transaction speeds. The gas fee is as low as $0.001 per transaction with a TPS of up to 100,000. This impressive stat helped Bitgert get famous and now has over 600K followers on X.",
        "What’s Bitgert’s Trading Value?",
        "The Bitgert coin is trading at $0.0000002409 which is up 60% in the last month. The coin reached a peak of $0.00000045 this month which generated a lot of interest. Early investors of even a mere $100 grew their investments multifolds. Holders of Bitgert are bullish thanks to the innovation of the team. The strong community is regularly discussing the latest developments of the team on social media.",
        "",
        "Is it Too Late to Buy?",
        "Experts predict the Bitgert coin to surge further with some expecting the coin to surge to a value of $0.0001 soon. That’s an impressive 200% surge from its current price. Moreover, Bitgert is yet to be listed on major exchanges. This seems to be made a reality following the coins listing on Europe’s largest exchange. Following a major listing, the coin can gain some widespread attention and attract more buyers. This can drive the price up further. The Bitgert team has also developed some products like the Bitgert swap and exchange aiming at an ecosystem that seems to further drive the price in the coming weeks.",
        "Conclusion",
        "The cryptocurrency market is full of opportunities for some multifold gains. Experts seem to have their eyes on the Bitgert coin thanks to its innovative, fast and low-cost transactions. The coin has gained popularity for its innovations and seems to be the coin to bet on for some great gains in the long run.",

        "Mitchell Amador, Founder and CEO at Immunefi, commented that “while it’s positive that overall losses have decreased, it’s essential to note that DeFi faced significant challenges, accounting for 100% of total losses in Q1 2024.”",

        "In the second place, BNB Chain suffered 14 incidents, or 22% of total losses.",
        "Together, these two chains accounted for over half of the chain losses in Q1 2024, totaling 73%.",
        "Other affected chains include Arbitrum, Solana, Optimism, Bitcoin, Blast, Polygon, Conflux Network, and Base, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile, most of the $336 million was lost by two projects.",
        "In January, Orbit Bridge, the bridging service of the cross-chain protocol Orbit Chain, suffered a whopping $81.7 million exploit.",
        "In March, Munchables, a non-fungible token (NFT) game on the Ethereum layer 2 Blast, suffered an exploit resulting in $62.8 million in losses.",
        "These two projects lost $144,480,000 in total, representing 43% of Q1 losses, the report said.",

        "In total, hackers stole $321,645,400 in Q1 2024 across 46 specific incidents. This is a 23.1% decrease compared to Q1 2023, when losses caused by hacks totaled $418,589,089.",
        "On the other hand, $14,665,817 was lost to fraud in Q1 2024 across 15 incidents. It’s a 22.4% decrease compared to Q3 2022, when losses caused by frauds, scams, and rug pulls totaled $18,894,454, Immunefi said.",
        "Meanwhile, Immunefi, which protects over $60 billion in Web3 user capital, offers over $155 million in available bounty rewards.",

        "O’Leary recently stated on the Web3 Deep Dive podcast that he would implement digital asset features on a compliant basis if he were to buy the popular social media platform.",
        "“I think using digital payment systems on a platform like TikTok has potential. There’s no question about it,” said O’Leary.",
        "",
        "",
        "O’Leary elaborated that since TikTok is a “global phenomenon” it would give a lot of users around the world greater ease of access to cryptocurrencies for conducting digital payment transfers between countries.",
        "“This would have to be compliant, transparent, and obviously auditable so users would know who sent and received transactions. I would provide that. I think that’s the potential of a platform this large,” O’Leary remarked.",
        "Is TikTok Ready For Cryptocurrency?",
        "Although TikTok’s potential sale is still underway, industry experts believe that implementing cryptocurrency into the platform may be beneficial for the app moving forward.",
        "Alexander Mamasidikov, Founder and CEO of digital payment solution platform CrossFi, told Cryptonews that incorporating crypto payments into TikTok could play a positive role in spreading crypto content as well.",
        "“A main feature of TikTok is the phenomenon of self-reproduction, which is the willingness of users to generate mass content on their own,” said Mamasidikov. “Supporting cryptocurrency would allow users to create crypto-focused content on a huge scale.”",
        "Mamasidikov added that mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency would likely take off given TikTok’s Generation Z user base.",
        "“TikTok users are typically open to innovation, appreciate quick solutions to problems, and can easily incorporate new technologies into everyday life,” he said.",
        "Shira Lazar, Founder and CEO of news outlet What’s Trending, told Cryptonews that incorporating cryptocurrency as gifts during TikTok live streams or as tipping mechanisms could be a smart move for the platform.",
        "“This seems pretty obvious as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream,” said Lazar.",
        "Lazar – who has over 620,000 followers on TikTok – further noted that if TikTok users can earn fiat, the same option should be made available for cryptocurrency payments.",
        "“Why should TikTok not consider crypto as an option? More people seem to be holding crypto over cash internationally, as well,” she said.",
        "To Lazar’s point, crypto adoption is very apparent in countries like El Salvador, where Bitcoin has been accepted as legal tender since 2021. Other countries like Nigeria and Turkey also rank as the biggest adopters of cryptocurrency this year.",
        "Challenges Implementing Cryptocurrency on TikTok",
        "Although cryptocurrency payments may be a logical next step for an app like TikTok, challenges are likely to arise.",
        "Tim Delhaes, CEO of smart-wallet provider Grindery, told Cryptonews that while incorporating crypto payments into social media platforms represents a big opportunity, compliance and regulation may be problematic.",
        "Speaking from experience, Delhaes shared that Grindery recently announced an integration with the messaging platform Telegram to allow users to leverage cryptocurrency within the app.",
        "“Grindery enables Telegram users to create a wallet without needing passphrases or private keys. Users can then send any token to other Telegram users without knowing their wallet addresses, and swap tokens quickly and without gas fees,” said Delhaes.",
        "Grindery is still in its beta stage, yet Delhaes noted that the platform has already attracted over 700,000 sign-ups. While notable, Delhaes pointed out that meeting regulations hasn’t been an easy task.",
        "“Grindery’s focus on Telegram stems from shared values in decentralization and privacy,” he said. “Overcoming these challenges requires innovative approaches to compliance, leveraging blockchain’s transparency and security features, and working closely with regulatory bodies to ensure all operations meet legal standards.”",
        "This is important to point out, especially given the United States’ critical stance toward cryptocurrency.",
        "Regulations aside, Mamasidikov believes that the biggest challenge regarding cryptocurrency payments on TikTok will be technology related.",
        "“When implementing the technology, it will be necessary to provide for the possibility of payment messages,” he said. “This will allow users to transfer funds to each other seamlessly through the messenger built into the social network.”",
        "Lazar noted that TikTok could partner with crypto-friendly platforms like Paypal, Venmo, or Cashapp to ensure sufficient payment options.",
        "Cryptocurrency May Be Future of Social Media",
        "Regardless of challenges, Delhaes noted that crypto payments have the potential to transform social media platforms into “Super Apps.”",
        "“This evolution is crucial for content creators, offering them new revenue streams, greater control over their earnings, and direct financial interactions with their audience, free from platform-specific constraints,” he said.",
        "Delhaes pointed out that this has already been demonstrated by WeChat. The messaging platform incorporated digital yuan payments into its platform last year.",
        "Yet in order for this model to be successful, Delhaes stressed the need for separation between blockchain payments and core business functions. If this isn’t ensured, he pointed out that cryptocurrencies within TikTok could fail similarly to Facebook’s Libra project, or Telegram’s 2018 token launch.",
        "Mamasidikov further remarked that he believes alternative payment solutions will be implemented within many social networks in the future. He noted that this will also enable financial tools for citizens in developing countries that may not have access to traditional banking methods.",
        "“I can say with confidence that the era when financial instruments were unavailable to 60% of the world’s population will end very soon,” he said. “Any person on the planet, regardless of their place of residence, origin, wealth, will be able to use banking products and money transfers without a bank as social media platforms mature.”"

        "SBF’s Fraud Was A Game, Judge Rules",
        "Kaplan likened Bankman-Fried’s theft of nearly $8 billion in customer funds to “a game,” where he weighed “the cost of getting caught discounted by probability or improbability, against the gain of getting away without getting caught, given the probabilities.”",
        "“That was his game,” Kaplan said. “ It started at least as early as Jane Street and it continued to the very end. It’s his nature.”",
        "Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven fraud charges in November 2023 after a whirlwind trial that saw the FTX founder testify in his own defense.",
        "In Thursday morning’s ruling, Kaplan called Bankman-Fried’s defense “misleading, logically flawed, and speculative,” saying he had never seen a “performance” like his testimony throughout his entire career.",
        "“To put it in more colloquial terms, a thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on the sentence by using his Las Vegas winnings to pay back all or part of what he stole when if or when he gets caught,” Kaplan continued.",

        "Bankman-Fried Apologizes, But Is He Truly Sorry?",
        "A visibly thinner Bankman-Fried was escorted into the courtroom by two security guards in a beige jumpsuit, his hair still in its signature curly mop.",
        "“I know a lot of people feel really let down, and they were right, they were, were very let down,” Bankman-Fried told the court. “I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry about what happened at every stage, things I should have done and said, and things I shouldn’t have. I failed everyone I care about and everything I care about too.”",
        "He went on to apologize to his FTX colleagues, his brother Gabe, and those impacted by the exchange’s collapse, claiming that it “haunts” him every day and causes him “excruciating guilt.”",
        "However, he doubled down on his claim that the exchange “always” had enough assets to cover its losses.",
        "Bankman-Fried’s new lawyer, Marc Mukasey, largely tried to deflect from his client’s image as a “monster” to that of a seemingly awkward math nerd who was well-meaning but ultimately flawed.",
        "“SBF doesn’t make decisions with malice in his heart,” Mukasey said. “He makes decisions with math in his head.”",

        "Bankman-Fried was facing a total maximum penalty of 110 years in prison, with prosecutors pushing for upwards of 40 years for the former “king of crypto.”",
