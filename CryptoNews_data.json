        "Newly-approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could potentially hit the market by mid-June.\n",
        "Following the successful 19b-4 filings for spot Ether ETFs, which allow them to be listed on exchanges, the next step is to obtain approved S-1 registration statements before trading can commence.\n",
        "Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart predicts that the S-1 approvals could be granted in a “couple of weeks,” although he acknowledges that the process may take longer, typically spanning up to five months.\n",
        "However, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a mid-June launch is certainly possible.\n",
        "Balchunas expects a single round of comments to the S-1 amendments, similar to the feedback provided for spot Bitcoin ETF applicants, which could facilitate a quicker approval timeline.\n",
        "The imp part is over. Now just logistics. My guess is there’s only one round of comments on the S-1s. And during btc one round took two weeks ish. So I this mid June is certainly poss. Just a guess tho. We will see.\n",
        "— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 23, 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "VanEck Files Amended S-1\n",
        "VanEck, one of the applicants, wasted no time and filed its amended S-1 shortly after receiving approval for the 19b-4 filings. Other applicants are anticipated to follow suit in the near future.\n",
        "However, Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, points out that the SEC’s approval was granted by its Division of Trading and Markets unit under delegated authority. He suggests that one of the five SEC Commissioners could challenge the decision within the next 10 days.\n",
        "Nevertheless, digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare believes that such a challenge is unlikely, stating that passing it through the trading and markets division indicates no opposition from the Commissioners.\n",
        "Regarding market expectations, Seyffart predicts that spot Ether ETFs could attract approximately 20% of the flows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen.\n",
        "On the other hand, Balchunas offers a more conservative estimate of 10-15%.\n",
        "Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs approximately four and a half months ago, they have accumulated $13.3 billion in net inflows, according to Farside Investors.\n",
        "Even capturing 20% of that figure would result in spot Ether ETFs amassing a combined $2.66 billion in inflows over a similar timeframe.\n",
        "Grayscale Ethereum Trust Could See Outflows\n",
        "However, concerns have arisen around potential outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust if investors shift their holdings to spot Ether ETFs, mirroring the outflows witnessed with the conversion of Grayscale’s Bitcoin investment product.\n",
        "The Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently holds over $11.3 billion in assets, as reported by Arkham Intelligence.\n",
        "On May 23, regulatory approval was granted to eight applicants, including VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Bitwise, and Invesco Galaxy.\n",
        "One ETF issuer, Hashdex, did not receive approval on that particular day, standing as the exception.\n",
        "As reported, Singapore-based QCP Capital believes the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States could potentially trigger a substantial rally of up to 60% in the price of ETH.\n",
        "QCP Capital pointed out that when spot bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, Bitcoin experienced a significant surge from $42,000 to over $73,000 within a two-week period after the ETFs began trading.\n",
        "“With Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,” QCP Capital stated.\n"

        "\n",
        "For the past 30 days ending May 14, meme coin prices surged despite the overall market continuing to capitulate from mid-March highs following Bitcoin notching a two-year plus all-time record price high. Pepe Coin (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Floki (FLOKI) all led cryptocurrency gains. Floki moved 34% higher on crypto exchanges. Pepe went parabolic 110%.\n",
        "Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck launched a Meme Coin Index, a big break for dog money on Wall Street. Meme finance is so hot in May that the original meme stock, Gamestop (NYSE:GME), moved up the chart over 100% this week, after the Reddit WallStreetBets forum member who led its first bull run in Jan. 2021 posted for the first time in three years.\n",
        "Meme Coins: Are The Dog Days Over?\n",
        "As theCryptoBubbles.net graphic above shows, the ROI is coming in dank this year:\n",
        "When it first launched just last year, PEPE boldly predicted, “The Dog Days Are Over.”\n",
        "Not that e-currencies like Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, and Bonk are going anywhere. With potentially millions of users and market capitalizations of $21 billion, $4.6 billion, and $1.5 billion for these three coins, respectively, they’re now small economies in their own right.\n",
        "And Dogecoin was once a $4.6 billion market cap coin, and Pepe was once a $1.5 billion “joke” blockchain project. So they could be well on their way to greater adoption in the future. Dogs like Dogecoin, Bonk, and Shiba Inu are probably here to stay.\n",
        "But their early return percentages probably are not.\n",
        "The big doge currencies still check out, but they’re older memes now. Unfortunately for crypto investors late to get these pieces into their bags, they have already outgrown the ultra-steep early adoption curves of so many new Internet currencies in the 2020s.\n",
        "Doge coins are simply not secrets anymore, new currencies that start off their product life cycle worth basically $0 on the open crypto exchange market.\n",
        "Early investor returns on the most successful projects in meme currency are so unbelievable that most people won’t bother to pounce on these opportunities even though they absurdly outperform Bitcoin and most stocks.\n",
        "The Best Kept Secret In Crypto Altcoin Markets\n",
        "After just 12 months on the market, PEPE may already be a conservative investment that cannot deliver the kind of moonshot price launches that successful new projects can.\n",
        "So if the dog days are over and the frog days are too, where is an impatient altcoin degenerate with a low loss aversion to look for new meme coins that can really take flight?\n",
        "Although this is probably not a strategy a typical financial advisor would recommend, or that you would be likely to find in any classical investing text, and actually sounds totally insane– one way to appraise new meme coins prospects’ is to ask: Would anime fans dig this?\n",
        "Dogecoin was the first meme coin and today it is a Top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap. The effigy gracing the coin and several of its successful peers is the Doge meme from 2013.\n",
        "The Shiba Inu is a popular Japanese dog breed, so anime fans love it.\n",
        "The Pepe meme, meanwhile, became popular on the 4/chan boards. The power users on this *not safe for work* website are big fans of anime.\n",
        "One theory gaining traction in the altcoin community in Q2 2024 is that cat memes are up next for adorable big launches and super cute enormous rallies.\n",

        "The US House on Thursday approved a bill that prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar, or central bank digital currency (CBDC), without explicit authorization from Congress.\n",
        "This legislation, known as the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act (HR 5403), passed with a vote of 216 to 192. Republicans voiced worries that a US CBDC could be used for government control over citizens’ finances.\n",
        "The Fed itself hasn’t yet come out with a solid proposal to launch a digital dollar. But, the House vote reflects ongoing concerns among Republicans – including former President Trump – about potential government overreach with such a system.\n",
        "House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who introduced the legislation, argued a digital dollar could be a “surveillance tool” for the government, giving it the power to track transactions and potentially restrict activity they deem politically undesirable.\n",
        "His stance echoes Trump’s strong opposition to a CBDC, as the current Presidential candidate has vowed to block its creation if re-elected.\n",

        "Thursday’s vote marks a significant difference from the prior floor vote. On Wednesday, 71 Democrats and 208 Republicans passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).\n",
        "This bill focuses on a fresh crypto market structure and grants the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission more authority over digital assets in spot markets. It also outlines the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approach towards the sector.\n",
        "Industry Rejoices, But Can FIT21 Pass Biden’s Scrutiny?\n",
        "Wednesday’s vote marks a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It is the first time a bill solely focused on crypto market regulation passed the House. But even though the crypto industry celebrates the FIT21 vote, challenges remain.\n",
        "Alan Mittleman, COO of Secure Digital Markets, told Cryptonews that the bill needs a companion version for the Senate. This new version will need committee revisions and face potential opposition from vocal crypto critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren. In short, the bill’s journey to becoming law is far from over.\n",
        "According to Mittleman, President Joe Biden seems worried that there aren’t enough consumer protections in FIT21. “He hasn’t threatened a veto yet. But that suggests more work may be required on the bill to go through,” he added.\n"

        "Bitcoin’s current market position has sparked renewed interest in Bitcoin price prediction. Trading at $67,836.31 with a 24-hour trading volume of $42.4 billion, Bitcoin has dipped 2.27% in the last 24 hours.\n",
        "As the leading cryptocurrency with a market cap of $1.3 trillion, its movements are closely watched, with traders focusing on key resistance and support levels to gauge future price trends.\n",
        "Bitcoin Price Prediction\n",
        "Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading at $67,835, down 2.25% over the past 24 hours, signalling a bearish Bitcoin price prediction. The green line at $68,263 serves as the pivot point, which is crucial for determining the trend direction.\n",
        "Immediate resistance levels are at $70,029, $71,458, and $73,299. These levels could act as significant barriers to upward movement. On the downside, support levels are identified at $66,357, $64,947, and $63,490, offering potential buying opportunities if the price continues to decline.\n",
        "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.35, indicating that Bitcoin is approaching oversold conditions, which could suggest a potential reversal or stabilization around this level. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $68,615, acting as a resistance level close to the pivot point.\n",
        "Technically, Bitcoin shows signs of potential bearish movement as it trades below the pivot point. An entry strategy would be to sell below $68,263, targeting a take-profit level of $66,357 and setting a stop loss at $70,029.\n",
        "This approach leverages the potential for further decline while managing risk.\n",
        "Conclusion: Bitcoin’s current price action suggests a bearish outlook as it trades below the pivot point of $68,263. Immediate resistance levels are at $70,030, $71,450, and $73,300, while support levels are at $66,357, $64,947, and $63,490.\n",

        "South Korean police have arrested 19 people on fraud charges in a swoop on a social media “crypto reading room.”\n",
        "Police think the international gang ran an “open chat room,” likely a crypto Telegram group or a KakaoTalk open chat, which pretended to offer bona fide crypto trading tips.\n",
        "Instead, officers said, the gang “defrauded 308 investors” out of some $18.8 million.\n",
        "Reading Room – ‘Crypto Fraud Gang Preyed on Victims’\n",
        "Police spokespeople said some gang members posed as crypto experts in chat groups. Others pretended to be ordinary investors.\n",
        "These members allegedly claimed to have made money by following tips they learned in the “reading room.”\n",
        "Per Global Kyungjae Shinmun, the Daegu Police Agency’s criminal task force announced it had made the arrests on May 21.\n",
        "However, the task force thinks at least six suspects are still at large. Police said these individuals are “still overseas.”\n",
        "The task force said it had asked Interpol to issue red notices for all six. This would require overseas police officers to arrest the suspects on sight.\n",
        "Police said the group sent out invitation links to “an open chat room,” hoping to ensnare potential victims.\n",
        "This room, police added, was populated with gang members who claimed they had made “big profits” by following advice posted in the room.\n",
        "Victims Lured onto Bogus Crypto Exchanges, Say Police\n",
        "Officers explained that the gang tried to convince room members to download apps connected to crypto exchanges, where they could buy and sell unlisted coins.\n",
        "The group then tried to build trust by ensuring potential victims made moderate gains when they invested minimal amounts of money in these allegedly bogus platforms.\n",
        "In many cases, this convinced victims to increase the value of their stakes. However, when victims tried to make withdrawals from the platforms, gang members told them to pay “withdrawal fees.”\n",
        "When they refused, the gang members would then break off contact, police officers explained. The task force said it was trying to locate the stolen funds.\n",
        "‘Gang Used Pig-butchering Tactics’\n",
        "Police said the gang’s ringleader used so-called “pig-butchering” recruitment tactics to increase the size of the gang.\n",
        "Officers said the ringleader promised several individuals employment in Myanmar. When they arrived in the country, however, the ringleader allegedly stole their passports and cell phones – and forced them to join the ring.\n",
        "The media outlet quoted a lawyer named Kwak Joon-ho as saying:\n",
        "“There has been a sharp rise in fraudulent schemes that make use of open chat rooms, including reading rooms. Perpetrators are likely to face both fraud and organized crime charges.”\n",
        "Earlier this week, police in Gwangju arrested 28 people on suspicion of duping about 50 crypto-keen South Koreans out of $1.3 million.\n"

        "In a dramatic turn of events, Tigran Gambaryan, a detained executive of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, collapsed in court due to alleged ill health during his ongoing money laundering trial on May 23, as reported by Vanguard.\n",
        "The incident occurred at the Federal High Court in Abuja shortly after the case was called for continuation before Justice Emeka Nwite.\n",
        "Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen, and British-Kenyan national Nadeem Anjarwalla face charges of laundering over $35 million and engaging in specialized financial activities without a license. Both executives have pleaded not guilty.\n",
        "Detained Binance Executive Slumped During Trial\n",
        "The courtroom drama unfolded when Gambaryan, Binance’s head of financial crimes compliance, did not immediately step forward to the dock when the case was called. Seated in the back row, he was assisted by his lawyer towards the dock but collapsed en route and had to be sat in the front row.\n",
        "Gambaryan’s lawyer informed the court of his client’s deteriorating health and the submission of a written application notifying the court of his condition.\n",
        "“My lord, the case may not certainly proceed today,” Mordi stated, explaining that Gambaryan had been indisposed and required medical attention.\n",

        "— Vanguard Newspapers (@vanguardngrnews) May 23, 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "Since February, Gambaryan’s health issues have reportedly worsened. A letter presented to Judge Emeka Nwite highlighted that Gambaryan had broken down and received intravenous treatment for malaria the previous day. Consequently, he was also absent from a tax evasion trial held the day before.\n",
        "Judge Nwite ruled that Gambaryan should receive treatment at the hospital recommended by his lawyer or another designated by prison authorities. The trial has been adjourned to June 20 and 21 to allow Gambaryan’s medical treatment.\n",
        "The case has attracted considerable attention, especially given Nigeria’s ongoing economic challenges. The country has accused Binance of contributing to its currency woes, as Binance and other cryptocurrency platforms have become famous for trading the Nigerian naira amid severe dollar shortages and a plummeting currency.\n",
        "Throughout the proceedings, Gambaryan was visibly weak, leaning on the armrest of his seat.\n",
        "Tax Evasion Charges Against Binance\n",
        "The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has filed tax evasion charges against Binance Holdings Limited and Gambaryan. Due to his absence, however, the trial could not proceed on Wednesday and has now been moved to June 14.\n",
        "Gambaryan, reportedly held at Kuje Prison, did not appear for his scheduled arraignment, confusing the lawyers. Justice Emeka Nwite, overseeing the case, had previously denied Gambaryan’s bail application due to new money laundering charges filed by the EFCC and deemed him a flight risk. The prosecution and defense argued over the failure to ensure Gambaryan’s presence, leading to the adjournment.\n",
        "Gambaryan’s absence from the arraignment session highlighted procedural issues, as his lawyer argued that the prosecution should have ensured his presence given his federal custody status.\n",
        "Anjarwalla, who escaped custody in March, is still involved in the case but has not been officially marked as “at large,” which could complicate proceedings since Nigerian law requires all parties to be served for the case to move forward.\n"

        "The SEC’s decision comes as a surprise to many market observers. Previous interactions between the regulatory body and ETF issuers gave little indication of impending approvals, leading to speculation about the catalyst for this sudden shift. Some sources point to recent bipartisan pressure from House lawmakers urging the SEC to align its treatment of Ethereum ETFs with its prior acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n",

The Grayscale Ethereum Trust, for example, witnessed its discount shrink from 24% to 6% as its conversion to an ETF draws nearer. The conversion allows holders to exchange shares for the equivalent cash value of the underlying Ether.\n",

Similarly, the AMF previously warned against the Bitget crypto exchange for similar reasons, noting its blacklisting in November 2023.

        "Salame, who previously requested a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison, pled guilty to a campaign finance violation and operating an illegal money-transmitting business related to his role as CEO of FTX’s Bahamian subsidiary, FTX Digital Markets.\n",
        "Former FTX Exec Ryan Salame Could See 5 – 7 Years In Prison\n",
        "Prosecutors allege Salame orchestrated “efforts to allow customers to send and receive fiat currency to fund their FTX accounts through U.S.-based bank accounts without complying with federal registration requirements” and took part in a straw donor scheme that saw over $100 million in illegal donations shuffled through the American political system.\n",
        "“The campaign finance offense is one of the largest-ever in American history, and the unlicensed money transmitting business exchanged more than $1 billion without proper supervision,” the court filing read. “Those are serious crimes, and a substantial sentence is required to ensure that Salame receives just punishment.”\n",

        "Salame marks the first FTX executive to be sentenced since Bankman-Fried was handed a 25-year sentence and ordered to forfeit $11 billion in March following his landmark fraud trial last fall that saw a handful of high-ranking employees from the now disgraced crypto exchange testify against him in hopes of a lighter sentence themselves.\n",
        "Several key players in the fraud scheme are facing charges for their role in the multi-billion dollar crypto scam, including former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, FTX’s Head of Engineering Nishad Singh, and FTX co-founder Gary Wang.\n",
        "SBF, who has been serving out his sentence at Metropolitan Detention Sentence in New York, will likely be heading back west following news this week that U.S. authorities are preparing paperwork for his transfer to a prison in his home state of California.\n",
        "Salame is currently scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday at 11 a.m. in Manhattan federal court. It’s currently unclear when Ellison, Singh, and Wang will be sentenced.\n"

        "Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is considering allowing issuers of Ethereum ETFs to offer Ether staking, according to a Thursday Bloomberg report.\n",
        "The potential development has sparked considerable interest as it could greatly impact the future of Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong. The SFC’s consideration follows their recent approval of a Bitcoin ETF, which came three months after the U.S. approved ten spot ETFs.\n",
        "Contrasting Approaches: Hong Kong SFC vs. US SEC\n",
        "The SFC’s approach contrasts sharply with the stance the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took. The SEC views staking services as investment contracts, potentially violating securities laws. This perspective is clear from recent amendments made by major financial institutions, such as Fidelity, who removed staking from their latest S1 filing for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n",
        "Last year, the SEC’s classification of staking services as securities forced platforms like Kraken Exchange to shut down their staking services in the U.S. Coinbase, however, is challenging this stance. In March 2023, they submitted a “Petition for Rulemaking,” arguing that core staking, lacking a direct monetary investment and with opportunity costs not qualifying as investments, shouldn’t be classified as a security.\n",

        "On May 22, the US House of Representatives voted to pass the crypto-friendly legislation known as the FIT21 Act. The act proposes shifting control of cryptocurrency oversight from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an agency perceived as more amenable to the crypto industry.\n",
        "Under the FIT21 Act, crypto operators in the US could gain expanded liberties and digital assets would likely be categorized as commodities rather than securities. The potential shift is important as it could lead to the reclassification of crypto staking, potentially clearing the way for approval of US Ethereum ETFs. The FIT21 Act still requires Senate approval and the President’s signature to become law, however, making its future uncertain.\n"

        "The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act’s (FIT21) approval on Wednesday would align the US with other nations in terms of its regulatory framework for crypto, according to Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the Chamber of Progress.\n",
        "Bligen told Cryptonews in an interview Thursday that if the FIT21 bill passes the Senate and becomes law, it would stop crypto companies from leaving the US for countries with clearer regulations.\n",
        "The legislation would provide increased freedoms to cryptocurrency operators in the US. Additionally, it would shift more regulatory responsibility for digital assets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n",
        "It would also make it clear which businesses the SEC and CFTC regulate and would create a system for registering these businesses. This would allow them to legally serve customers who want to buy and sell digital assets. The SEC would oversee digital assets that are considered securities, while the CFTC would oversee things like commodities and derivatives related to digital assets.\n",
        "Outdated Law Hinders US Crypto Regulation\n",
        "Bligen pointed out the fact that the US has been using a nearly century-old law, the Howey Test, from the SEC to regulate cryptocurrency that was invented just a few years ago. He argued that the current system is outdated and doesn’t work for this technology.\n",
        "“Hopefully this [bill] establishes the US as a regulatory leader that wants strong consumer protections,” he said. “We already have the most liquid, most attractive capital markets in the US. There’s no reason why we can’t have the best cryptocurrency markets as well.”\n",
        "FIT21 Seen as Crypto Talent Retainer\n",
        "Harry Sudock, chief strategy officer at Bitcoin miner GRIID, agrees that the bill would propel the US to a competitive position in the international crypto scene. Additionally, he believes FIT21 would incentivize the brightest minds in crypto to come to and stay in the US.\n",
        "“We’ve seen a number of businesses either leave the US or decline to do business here thanks to regulatory uncertainty,” he said. “FIT21 will help those businesses return to the US, but the bill is really only just the start.”\n",
        "FIT21’s House Hurdle Cleared, Senate Showdown Looms\n",
        "FIT21’s journey to becoming law isn’t over yet. While it successfully cleared the House, it still faces an uphill battle. The bill needs to be approved by the Senate and then signed by the President before it becomes law. Whether the Senate will give it the green light remains to be seen.\n",
        "Ronen Cojocaru, CEO of automated crypto trading platform 8081, highlighted the unique challenges crypto bills face in the Senate. Some senators are familiar with the technology and may be vocal supporters or opponents of the FIT21 Act. However, others might lack a deep understanding of the intricacies of cryptocurrency, making them undecided on the bill’s merits.\n",
        "“Public opinion and upcoming elections influence Senators’ decisions, aligning them with their party’s agenda and voter interests,” he said. “Senators can use a filibuster, requiring 60 votes to advance the bill, which is tough without strong bipartisan support.”\n",
        "Cojocaru also explained why the US is currently lagging behind other countries. He pointed to Switzerland, nicknamed “Crypto Valley,” as a prime example. Switzerland’s financial regulator, FINMA, fosters innovation by providing clear guidelines for crypto businesses, making it a global hub for the industry.\n",
        "Singapore has also attracted many crypto companies with its well-defined regulations and supportive policies. Its central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has struck a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding consumers. Similarly, Malta, known as the “Blockchain Island,” has become a magnet for crypto businesses with its comprehensive and crypto-friendly regulations.\n",
        "CFTC vs. SEC in Regulating Crypto\n",
        "Meanwhile, James Koutoulas founder at Typhon Capital Management, said FIT21 needs some work, especially for DeFi. Additionally, he highlighted the unprecedented power it gives the CFTC to regulate crypto as a spot commodity, which falls outside its usual domain of regulating commodity derivatives.\n",
        "“But, at least at the present time, the CFTC is infinitely less hostile to crypto than the SEC and seems focused on implementing regulatory pathways instead of maliciously attacking market leaders without the statutory authority to do so like the SEC,” Koutoulas said.\n"

        "Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET and the Dutch police uncovered a major crypto theft linked to the notorious Ebury botnet last week. The botnet has compromised over 400,000 servers in the past 15 years, making it a major threat to the sector.\n",
        "ESET explained in a May 14 report that the Ebury botnet incident was first uncovered during a 2021 investigation by the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU).\n",
        "Ebury Botnet Operators Used AitM Attack to Steal Funds\n",
        "The operatives found that the cybercriminals had been involved in a series of crypto thefts, specifically targeting Ethereum and Bitcoin nodes. According to the Dutch police, Botnet operators steal assets from unsuspecting users’ wallets when they enter their credentials on the infected servers.\n",
        "The Ebury botnet, active since at least 2009, is used to deploy additional malware, monetize the botnet (such as modules for web traffic redirection), proxy traffic for spam, perform adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks, and host supporting malicious infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "AitM attacks involve intercepting and potentially altering the communication between two parties without their knowledge.\n",
        "Between February 2022 and May 2023, the Ebury botnet compromised over 200 AitM attack targets across 75 networks in 34 countries. It stole cryptos, credentials, and credit card details, accumulating large sums of money over time.\n",
        "The access enables them to steal funds directly from these wallets or use compromised systems to mine cryptocurrencies, siphoning off resources from unwitting victims. The botnet’s ability to stay undetected for long periods allows it to continue its operations, accumulating large amounts of cryptocurrency over time.\n",
        "Crypto Theft on the Rise\n",
        "The Ebury botnet’s ability to compromise many servers has created the go-to malware needed to facilitate large-scale cryptocurrency theft, which is already rapidly increasing.\n",
        "Recall that PeckShield’s data shows that $336.8 million of crypto funds were stolen in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. The Certik Hac3d Report also revealed that Q1 2024 recorded substantial losses, exceeding $500 million due to cryptocurrency theft, however. This figure marks a 54% increase compared to the same period in 2023, which saw losses of about $326 million.\n",
        "\n",
        "Certik’s report highlighted that January 2024 was particularly severe, with $193 million stolen across 78 incidents. Private key compromises were especially notable, resulting in the loss of $239 million across just 26 incidents.\n",
        "These breaches, targeting the unique keys that individuals use to access their cryptocurrency holdings, accounted for nearly half of all financial losses despite making up only 11.7% of all reported security breaches.\n"

        "Know-your-customer (KYC) solutions are becoming increasingly important for crypto companies, financial services firms, and institutions.\n",
        "Grand View Research found that the global KYC software market size was valued at $2.93 billion in 2021. The number is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.8% over the next six years.\n",
        "Grand View Research’s report further noted the growth of the KYC market, which can be attributed to the importance of compliance management and the rising number of identity-related frauds in financial institutions. The rise of deep fakes and artificial intelligence (AI) related scams is also leading to greater KYC adoption.\n",
        "The Problem With Traditional KYC Solutions\n",
        "While KYC is an important requirement, the process is often a burden for both users and businesses.\n",
        "Riley Hughes, Co-founder and CEO of digital identity startup Trinsic, told Cryptonews that users undergoing KYC typically have to provide a photo of themselves, along with an identification document.\n",
        "As KYC becomes more common, Hughes pointed out that users typically have to repeat this process multiple times.\n",
        "“A person will likely have to perform KYC about ten different times across multiple apps and platforms,” said Hughes. “But statistics show that asking users to verify themselves using a photograph of a plastic ID card results in as much as 40% drop-off.”\n",
        "Vishal Kapoor, Chief Operating Officer of blockchain technology firm Chia Network, further told Cryptonews that KYC is expensive to implement.\n",
        "A recent article from Betanews mentioned that KYC measures amount to 40% of all anti-money laundering (AML) compliance costs, totaling $5.7 million yearly for banks.\n",
        "Reusable KYC Gains Traction\n",
        "Given these challenges, reusable KYC solutions have started to gain traction.\n",
        "“Reusable identification, or KYC, allows users to leverage past verification instead of having to re-verify themselves across platforms,” said Hughes.\n",
        "To put this in perspective, Hughes explained that Trinsic recently launched an “identity acceptance network” that enables reusable KYC.\n",
        "“Businesses can now use Trinsic to verify 60,800,000 people 10 times faster than a from-scratch identity verification, while also reducing fraud,” he said.\n",
        "Today Trinsic is launching the first identity acceptance network in partnership with dozens of world-class identity providers including @Clear, @getyoti, @enterIDVerse, @AirsideHQ an Entrust Company, and @dentityme.\n",

        "— Trinsic (@trinsic_id) May 21, 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "Hughes explained that businesses including CLEAR – the technology company that operates biometric travel document verification at major airports – along with others, have partnered with Trinsic as part of the identity acceptance network.\n",
        "“The objective behind this network is to get users KYC verified as fast as possible to meet the business risk threshold,” he said. “If users have already been verified by a business in the network, we try to route other businesses in the network to that verification.”\n",
        "For example, if a CLEAR user possesses a CLEAR verification, they may use this again for other platforms within the identity acceptance network.\n",
        "Blockchain for Reusable KYC\n",
        "While reusable KYC solutions can save users and businesses time and money, adding blockchain to the mix enables users to own their personal information and data.\n",
        "For example, identity technology company Dentity is part of Trinsic’s identity acceptance network. Dentity CEO Jeffrey Schwartz told Cryptonews that the platform stores users’ credentials on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
        "“We store decentralized identifiers (DIDs) on-chain to verify the authenticity of issuers,” said Schwartz. “The only thing that needs to be on-chain is what is required to verify a credential.”\n",
        "Chia Network is also doing this. According to Kapoor, Chia’s verifiable credentials (VCs) allow a KYC provider to perform KYC by issuing a verifiable credentials token on-chain.\n",
        "“This enables service providers, such as Dapps, to verify that a user has undergone KYC verification with a trusted KYC provider — without requiring the user to reveal any personal information,” he said.\n",
        "Kapoor explained that people are seeking better protection of their personal information as identity scams rise. Panda Security statistics show that over 10 billion personal records have been exposed globally due to data breaches since March 2020.\n",
        "“Using VCs and DIDs on-chain, the individual can custody their own VC and decide to whom it can or should be shared, without risk of oversharing or data exposure,” Kapoor mentioned. “This also decreases the external touchpoints with their sensitive personal information.”\n",
        "Blockchain Protects User Data\n",
        "While it’s notable that reusable KYC is gaining traction, a number of concerns linger. For instance, a recent Reuters article pointed out that criminals can still quickly exploit automated KYC checks, putting a user’s information at risk.\n",
        "Storing data on-chain seeks to solve this problem. For example, Deloitte Switzerland began issuing reusable KYC credentials last year to enable access to global fundraising of digital assets. Polimec, a decentralized funding protocol developed on Polkadot, has partnered with Deloitte Switzerland to enable this feature.\n",
        ".@DeloitteCH-powered, @Web3foundation-sponsored, @Kiltprotocol Credentials. Ready to be used on @PolimecProtocol https://t.co/LK3Jw31bDQ\n",
        "— fabi (@FabianGompf) April 29, 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "Luca von Wyttenbach, the co-founder of Polimec, told Cryptonews that a KYC credential enables users to establish a digital self-sovereign identity by validating their data once they have had Deloitte.\n",
        "“After Deloitte has issued a KYC Credential, which is kept under a user’s control, they will be able to use it with different online services, the first being Polimec,” said Wyttenbach.\n",
        "He added that the website or service provider can rely on the shared data since it has been approved and certified by Deloitte.\n",
        "“This means that users only have to share the minimum necessary data about themselves,” he remarked.\n",
        "Wyttenbach further explained that Deloitte’s KYC credentials are anchored on the KILT Protocol. He noted that Deloitte conducts customers’ KYC and is the only party receiving and storing that data. Next, the data is created into a KYC Credential, which is hashed and stored in the user’s Deloitte wallet.\n",
        "“The hash is anchored on KILT, meaning that no personal information is stored on-chain. Users get to verify their data against the hash by presenting their credentials,” Wyttenbach said. “ In short, the credentials are pseudonymous – hence, all transactions and network participants on Polimec can be processed in a regulatory compliant and secure manner while preserving data privacy.”\n",
        "Challenges May Hamper Adoption\n",
        "While reusable KYC solutions on the blockchain are currently being used, challenges are still present.\n",
        "For instance, Julian Leitloff, Co-founder of the decentralized identity platform idOS Network, told Cryptonews that encouraging widespread adoption of reusable KYC solutions among users and service providers is a major hurdle.\n",
        "Echoing this, Schwartz remarked that Trinsic’s Identity Acceptance Network requires collaboration.\n",
        "“The idea behind this is that we all share user credentials,” he said. “I hope this collaboration will allow us to achieve that, but interoperability is key here.”\n",
        "Hughes is aware of this challenge. He shared that Trinsic’s Identity Acceptance Network currently covers over 60 million users, yet he believes that the platform needs to move forward aggressively.\n",
        "“Everyone in the EU will soon have access to a digital identity wallet,” said Hughes. “We will need to implement the same standards moving forward.”\n",
        "In addition, Leitloff pointed out that another major challenge around reusable KYC includes ensuring privacy and data security.\n",
        "“As user data must remain private and secure even when shared across multiple platforms,” he said.\n",
        "To address these challenges, Leitloff explained that idOS is implementing advanced encryption techniques such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to protect user data.\n",
        "“Promoting the use of standardized identity formats like W3C Verifiable Credentials ensures consistency and interoperability,” he said. “Utilizing decentralized storage networks will also enable data availability and reduce the risk of centralized points of failure.”\n"

        "BlockDAG, which is currently in Batch 14 of its presale, has grossed $30 million, significantly boosted by its exclusive keynote video that went viral after its launch at Shibuya Crossing. This event offered lucrative profit opportunities and passive income streams. Such success has led experts to predict a 30,000x ROI for BlockDAG, positioning it as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch in 2024.\n",

        "There’s a lot of chatter on social media about the Ethereum vs Solana rivalry due to recent price actions and TVL changes. According to Lunar Crush, Ethereum had a social dominance of 9.35% with 45.18 million interactions, and Solana had 8.85% with 42.4 million interactions, both with 85% positivity. However, Santiment data showed a decline, with Solana’s dominance at 4.7% and Ethereum’s at 7%.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite a slight decline, Ethereum surged slightly, indicating a weak bull trend. Meanwhile, Solana experienced consecutive uptrends, increasing notably since mid-May and showing a stronger bull trend. TVL for both has risen over the past month, with Solana seeing more increase.\n",
        "GameStop Token Price Surges Following Roaring Kitty’s Return; Analysts Advise Caution\n",
        "GameStop’s stock and crypto variations saw a spike following the return of retail trader “Roaring Kitty” (Keith Gill). The GameStop token price surged notably, while GameStop shares increased in value within two days. Roaring Kitty’s return on social media sparked this resurgence, echoing his influence during the 2021 bull market. Despite the surge, eToro analyst Josh Gilbert doubts its longevity. However, the GameStop token price remains profitable for now, holding some good gains. Despite the increase in market cap and trading volume, caution is advised by analysts.\n",

        "BlockDAG’s Global Impact: Keynote Display and X100 Miner\n",
        "BlockDAG has gained huge momentum in the cryptocurrency market and elevated its profile through a comprehensive display of its exclusive keynote video, which detailed its project and products, gaining widespread attention. This keynote was prominently featured on billboards at Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing, one of the world’s busiest pedestrian areas, highlighting the power of strategic marketing in the competitive crypto landscape.\n",
        "The keynote highlighted BlockDAG’s integration with major DeFi exchange platforms like Bitget and CoinEx. It also introduced its mining devices and a user-friendly crypto payment card. This card, which is in partnership with leading banking-as-a-service providers, enables seamless spending of BDAG and other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, without waiting for transaction approvals or undergoing complex KYC procedures. Accepted by 38 million merchants globally, the card is a testament to BlockDAG’s commitment to innovation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, BlockDAG demonstrates its commitment to easy and efficient passive income through its ASIC mining devices, the X series. Highlighting its powerhouse, the X100, a behemoth in cryptocurrency mining with a 2 TH/s hash rate and 1800W power consumption, earning up to 2,000 BDAG daily, equating to $100 at the official launch price. It balances performance with controlled noise, uses advanced ASIC technology for efficient block mining, and offers scalability for evolving needs, making it ideal for serious miners.\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "With social media buzzing about the Ethereum vs. Solana rivalry, Solana sees a greater increase in TVL. Although the GameStop token price surged after the return of retail trader “Roaring Kitty,” analysts advise caution due to longevity concerns about the project. On the other hand, BlockDAG has entered its Batch 14 with 9.4 billion coins and 5,895 miners sold, including the powerful X100, generating $30M in revenue, $2.6M of which comes from miner sales alone. Propelled by the viral keynote and its dazzling display at the Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo, BlockDAG’s success has experts predicting a solid 30,000x ROI potential, making BlockDAG one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch in 2024.\n",

        "The MEME Coin Challenge: Can It Make You a Millionaire?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the cryptocurrency space, nothing is certain. A petty small investment can make you a millionaire in no time. But as you know, all coins do not have that quality, and some are made to forge the investment. Authentic players of this space have strong features, backing, and use cases – they are the coin for the long run. BEFE is a coin of this line.\n",
        "As long as the crypto market has started gaining its speed, BEFE is all in green colours. BEFE has given a whopping return of 550% to its earlier investors, and then the correction period came. Now, everything is back on track again. BEFE prices jumped by almost 40% in a single day earlier this week. Investors are giving a bullish call to invest in BEFE as this coin can shower millions for you. But why is the coin so special? Let’s know the reasons!\n",
        "BEFE’s Story\n",
        "BEFE came into existence in November 2023 with some not-so-common features. Usually, coins create hype and increase their value with presale, but BEFE was different in this case. There was no presale for BEFE coin, the total number of coins was for only the common investors. BEFE does not have any crypto taxation as well, investors are allowed to take all the profit home that they earn by BEFE trading. This unorthodox approach makes BEFE a coin for all.\n",
        "The BEFE token asserts that it is the most humorous memecoin ever made. The same Inu \u0026 Frog coins have had their moment in the sun, now it is the time for the most popular memecoin to ascend to the position of ultimate meme king on the internet – this goes the BEFE’s motto. BEFE will bring memecoins back to their former glory, for sure.\n",
        "And to make this possible, the BEFE team is working tirelessly. BEFE has a strong community of 50K on its X account where they keep releasing fresh and hilarious memes based on BEFE characters.\n",
        "BEFE is positioned as an integrated part of the Bitgert network. Bitgert is an affordable, secure, and quick Layer-1 blockchain system. Bitgert is a superfast blockchain with a speed of 100K TPS and of course, has no gas fee. Because of these qualities, BEFE is incredibly affordable and has a very long token life. If Bitgert owners invest BRISE tokens, they may purchase BEFE at a significant profit right now.\n",
        "BEFE can be swapped in almost every DEX including Gate.io, PancakeSwap, Uniswap, MEXC, Tapbit and BitStorage. The coin is compatible with Solana, Polygon, and Ethereum-like blockchains.\n",
        "Analysts predict that BEFE will hit $0.001, which would mean substantial growth potential for investors. Though BEFE’s journey is only beginning, it has already shown potential and is being enhanced.\n",
        "Which coin do you now believe to be the best?\n",
        "Even with BEFE possible, investing in cryptocurrency still entails some risk. Therefore, a comprehensive risk assessment and research are required before making any investments!\n",

        "However, after reaching a peak of $0.000680 a few hours ofter listing, it has since fallen to $0.0001708, representing a fall of 75%.\n",

        "It has risen slightly in the past hour, but as its history since 06:00 has shown, it has seen a few temporary and slight rebounds today, yet this hasn’t really reversed its decline.\n",
        "Also telling is the fact that its volume has all-but disappeared, another clear sign of a struggling token that has failed to attract wider interest.\n",
        "It’s for this reason that it would be sensible to steer clear of HAIR, even if it may potentially enjoy a resurgence in the future, in the case that interest in Trump and the upcoming election drives demand for a tangentially related meme coin.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Kaspa token has not seen the same bullish success as many cryptocurrencies this week from the Ethereum spot ETF approval rumors. On the week it’s value has increased by only 14.8% and 16.3% on the month. This stagger in value is causing many investors to sell and move, many following a continuing trend of migrating funds to the Mollars (MOLLARS) ICO.\n",
        "What is Kaspa blockchain?\n",
        "Kaspa (KAS) token is the native cryptocurrency of a new blockchain platform. It has a value of $0.13 [cents] today. This is $0.04-cents under its all-time high, reached on February 22nd.\n",
        "The reason the Kaspa blockchain platform is unique is its ability to resolve the creation of multiple ‘blocks’ on its chain at the same time. This unique process is known as Block Directed Acyclic Graph aka BlockDag.\n",
        "Many blockchains can not create multiple blocks at the same time, instead they select 1 to create and discard all others. This is known as ‘orphaning blocks,’ a discarding \u0026 declining of data.\n",

        },
        "Kaspa’s offering a solution to this issue, making it a more scalable solution than most. This includes being more scalable than the chain it’s inspired by — Bitcoin-blockchain.\n",
        "As other blockchains however, Kaspa needs 2 things; miners and adoption. Brand value needs to be created and various brands need to begin using the faster, more reliable blockchain to complete crypto transactions for its ecosystem to work.\n",
        "What is Kaspa (KAS) token used for?\n",
        "The $KAS token itself is a derivative of the Kaspa blockchain. Blocks are generated on the computers of independent miners and as those blocks are created, so are KAS tokens.\n",
        "These tokens are both used to pay the block miners and allow traders to invest and gain from the growth of the Proof-of-work x blockDAG blockchain.\n",
        "Thus far unfortunately, the token’s growth has been stunted. While memecoins like Pepe and Shiba Inu saw growth of their values by +50% and +115% in the past month, Kaspa (KAS) is far behind. The KAS token only rose in value +15%.\n",
        "A positive nonetheless, the +15% does signal that the token’s struggling to reach a bigger audience and investors are moving away. The +15% is the best case scenario but holders trading at a more rapid rate or who simply want bigger ROI yields appear to have begun moving funds to other directions.\n",
        "In a data analysis of the Mollars ICO, it appears Kaspa (KAS) token holders have become one of the top 10 most heavily vested in the project. As the Initial Coin Offering saw a huge surge in presales, paralleling the crypto market’s current bull run, Kaspa token migrants now make up over US$60,000 of the ICO’s funding pool.\n",
        "Priced at $0.55 [cents] per token today, this means Kaspa’s migrating holders own over 109,000 $MOLLARS before its CEX/DEX listing day, June 2nd.\n",
        "The migration is not much of a surprise as crypto traders are constantly moving funds. Both Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Tether (USDT) and Bonk Inu (BONK) whales have also been reported for moving into the Mollars token presale in heavy numbers.\n",
        "The results of this migration is Mollars ICO has generated an astounding $1.39-million-dollars in funds to further development and generate branding value aka demand. Over 2.937-million tokens have been presold, all of which will be claimed and show up on exchange’s ‘top lists’ come June 2nd.\n",
        "A potential powerhouse, the Mollars token appears to be generating a unique dynamic of ‘super brand value,’ before its release. Google trends even reports it as ‘half as popular’ as Pepe (PEPE) token and nearly just as popular as Bonk inu (BONK).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why are Investors buying Mollars cryptocurrency early?\n",
        "In comparison, those two tokens have over $3-billion-dollars in market cap and Mollars brand is already competing. This stat alone is the reason many investors likely see a ‘sky high’ potential for the new store-of-value token.\n",
        "Though this factor also leads to a conclusion of ‘profits’ theoretically, there’s also the fact that if the Mollars token reaches its hard cap the listing day price on exchanges is now known. A price of $0.62 (cents) has been published in various reports giving traders valuable information on immediate positive gains within less than 2 weeks.\n",
        "The 62-cent price is $0.07-cents greater than its current price; a +27% gain on every dollar invested. This means a sell-out of the ICO allocated tokens would generate today’s investors $1270 per $1000 invested. That’s a $270 take-home profit in a few days.\n",
        "With 3 exchanges already confirmed to list the Mollars (MOLLARS) token, its’ debut is certain as well. Bitmart, LBank, and XT.com have all announced their exchanges are places traders will be able to acquire or sell the token.\n",
        "Beyond ROI yields, educated traders are also stoked on the whitepaper of Mollars and it’s actual utility. A ‘store of value’ token, it’s designed to mimic Bitcoin (BTC), allowing traders to retain value of their money in these times of global economic crisis. As the world suffers from rising costs of living, fiat currency is becoming less valuable since no one is earning more. However, Mollars token is designed to go up in value against declining fiat currency.\n",
        "In layman’s terms, as more people invest in Mollars, the token’s value should increase.\n",
        "With a total token supply of only 10-million tokens, Mollars has under half that of Bitcoin. After the 10-millionth token is minted, no more will be created.\n",
        "In this ICO, 40% of that total supply is being sold to investors at a discount. The funds generated will create the liquidity pool, branding value, and token infrastructure itself; professionals are hired to create security and great product.\n",
        "Mollars.cc will be the only product generated by the team itself. It’s a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that will use bits of $MOLLARS tokens to complete transactions and increase scarcity. The amount of tokens it uses will be paralleling the DEX’s activity.\n",
        "The underlying blockchain of Mollars or Layer-1 tech is the Ethereum-Blockchain. Mollars chose this block because it houses over 250-million cryptocurrency wallets and has far less fees than Bitcoin-blockchain, while still being faster. This adds dependability to the overall project, as Ethereum-blockchain is set to be the most stable and trustworthy crypto blockchain of the entire industry. Mollars will be the first store-of-value token of its type on the ERC-20 networks and has various purposes that cannot be judged by prior market statistics. The predictions of value thus far of 20x to 44x could also be a gross understatement if the ‘search volume’ and branding value of it during this ICO stage are accurate omens to its future.\n",
        "Mollars is a formidable rival to Bitcoin (BTC) for Ethereum Blockchain’s 250-million linked wallets and a rational solution to BTC block’s out of control transaction fees. All of these reasons are why crypto traders, including Kaspa (KAS) holders, are now moving their funds to the Mollars ICO.\n"

This suggests that they could be moving towards the approval of these applications ahead of the key deadline on May 23, 2024, which could drive the Ethereum price up further and make it one of the best altcoins to buy.\n",
        "As for the on-chart metrics, they are now positive as the Ethereum crypto experienced a year-to-date (YTD) climb of 101%. As a result, sentiment is bullish on its future, and according to the Ethereum price prediction, it can end 2024 at $4,467.\n",

        "Signs that the market is overselling it comes from its relative strength index (purple), which fell below 50 earlier this morning, suggesting that BNB’s current price is too low.\n",
        "At the same, BNB’s 30-day moving average (orange) has begun dropping towards the 200-day (blue), in a sign of apparent weakness.\n",
        "However, given that it had only just crossed over the longer term average, it may resume rising again very soon, given that the coin appears to be in a medium-term growth phase.\n",
        "Also encouraging is BNB’s 24-hour trading volume, which at $1 billion is basically double where it was a couple of days ago.\n",
        "This signals strong interest in the token, which in turn suggests that its current dip will be slight, as traders rush in to buy the dip.\n",

        "The Federal High Court in Abuja has adjourned the tax evasion case against Binance Holdings Limited and its executive, Tigran Gambaryan, to June 14 due to Gambaryan’s absence from court. Gambaryan, who is reportedly held at Kuje Prison, failed to appear for his scheduled arraignment, leaving both his lawyer and the prosecuting counsel from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) unaware of his whereabouts.\n",
        "Justice Emeka Nwite is overseeing this case, which also involves co-defendant Binance. Last Friday, Justice Nwite denied Gambaryan’s bail application and ordered his remand in custody following new money laundering charges filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The judge cited overwhelming evidence from the EFCC that Gambaryan was a flight risk.\n",
        "During today’s session, FIRS lawyer Moses Ideho expressed confusion over Gambaryan’s absence, stating,\n",
        "“I don’t know the reason he is not here. We have been trying to get to members of the correctional center, but we have been unable to get why they are not here. The correctional center has the right to bring him to court.”\n",
        "In response, Gambaryan’s lawyer, Chukwuka Ikwuazo, SAN, argued that Ideho should be aware of the executive’s whereabouts, given that Gambaryan is under federal custody. He opposed the stand-down request, stating their presence in court since 9 am and questioning the need for delay. Both lawyers argued that the prosecution should have ensured Gambaryan’s presence.\n",
        "Tonye Krukrubo, SAN, representing Binance, also opposed the stand-down, asserting that the government’s lawyer should have anticipated the absence. Ideho sought an adjournment to verify the situation with the correctional officers, lamenting,\n",

        "Binance CEO Richard Teng criticized Nigeria’s approach in May, claiming it set a dangerous precedent after Binance executives were invited to the country and subsequently detained as part of a broader crackdown on cryptocurrency. The company is contesting the charges of tax evasion and money laundering.\n",
        "The charges against Binance and its executives, Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British Kenyan who is Binance’s regional manager for Africa, include four counts of tax evasion. These counts encompass failure to register with Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service for tax purposes.\n",
        "Anjarwalla, who escaped custody in March, remains listed in the case. His absence has not been officially marked as ‘at large,’ which could complicate proceedings as Nigerian law requires all parties to be served for the case to proceed. Gambaryan’s lawyer, Chukwuka Ikwuazom, highlighted this as a potential obstacle.\n",
        "In addition to the tax evasion charges, Binance and its executives face allegations of laundering more than $35 million brought by Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The money-laundering trial is scheduled for Thursday. Binance has stated it is cooperating closely with Nigerian authorities following Gambaryan’s detention.\n"

        "In the early years of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the lack of a clear regulatory framework made it difficult for corporations to even consider embracing digital assets.\n",

        "This ambiguity created significant risks for businesses keen to explore cryptocurrencies, as non-compliance with emerging regulations could lead to legal issues, fines, or even criminal charges.\n",
        "Over time, as the regulatory environment began to mature and more robust security measures were developed, companies started to recognize the potential benefits of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\n",

        "The initiative has expanded, with Goldman now offering a range of crypto investment products to its clients, including Bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards.\n",
        "In 2021, it was revealed that Goldman Sachs, ICAP, JPMorgan, and UBS had all bought the first exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe that offered exposure to Polkadot’s DOT cryptocurrency for clients.\n",

        "Regulatory Challenges\n",
        "Despite the potential benefits, companies adopting cryptocurrencies face significant regulatory challenges.\n",
        "The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, with different countries having varying stances on crypto assets.\n",
        "In the US, for example, the SEC has filed numerous lawsuits against crypto firms over the past few years, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler consistently asserting that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities.\n",

        "The cryptocurrency market is showing positive signs of an uptrend, with Bitcoin crossing the $70k mark, surpassing its 2021 mark of $69k. Investors are now seeking projects that can give them massive returns from investments as low as $100.\n",
        "Meme coins are known to be fast multipliers of capital, but they come with higher risks due to high volatility. The high volatility is a result of some not having proper utility backing. Bitgert has differentiated itself from other meme coins by meeting investors’ demand, and this is the reason for its sustainable growth.\n",
        "Experts have laid numerous opinions on their expectations.\n",
        "In this article, we will look at the feasibility of Bitgert giving mouth-watering returns from a $100 investment and what makes it the best option to becoming a millionaire.\n",
        "Bitgert Increasing Momentum Signifying Enormous Investors’ Return\n",
        "Bitgert’s growth has been evident with the rise in vital metrics like volume. CryptoVizer, a crypto expert, conducted examinations on Bitgert’s chart and noticed a surge in its trading volume. He explained that the rise signifies increasing investors’ interest in the project. He drew attention to Bitgert’s recent consistent uptrends and stated that it can maintain momentum due to the team’s commitment to innovative solutions.\n",
        "BitcoinMedia emphasized the importance of making judicious use of Bitgert as it has sufficient utilities to push its value higher. The group of crypto experts projects it to experience at least 150% of its current value before the year runs out. They pointed out that user satisfaction is the major reason for its constant value rise.\n",
        "Jonathan Turner, a technical analyst renowned for high accuracy, pointed out that investors should expect Bitgert’s momentum to get better as it has shown to be reliant on utilities other than BTC’s control. He gave an illustration of its soaring value despite BTC’s instability in August 2023. He also emphasized Bitgert’s being the perfect solution for investors seeking to make millions from the crypto industry.\n",
        "Bitgert Past Record Of Making Millionaires\n",
        "Bitgert, a project launched in July 2021 but rebranded in November due to the Bitgert’s chain integration, has recorded enormous growth. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitgert peaked at its All-Time High in 2022, where it made a huge uptrend of over 500%. Records show it recorded a series of uptrends in 2023 despite the unfavorable market conditions.\n",
        "Coingecko was able to give a statistical difference in percentage rise in growth, and it showed Bitgert hitting over 2000% value growth difference from its initial price to its peak price.\n",
        "Its early investors have been able to make enormous returns on investment. Although it has already recorded a huge uptrend, it shows no sign of slowing down as BitcoinWorldMedia made known analyst speculations on Bitgert making new millionaires by the end of the year.\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "Bitgert is investors’ best option to become a millionaire. Investors must scrutinize the project properly before investing. Needed details on it can be found on https://bitgert.com\n",

        "On Tuesday, holders purchased over 100,000 ETH in spot markets, marking the highest daily level since September 2023.\n",
        "The surge in buying coincided with reports of a favorable decision regarding spot Ether ETFs, leading some analysts to increase the odds of approval to over 75%, up from the earlier estimate of 25%.\n",
        "Furthermore, open interest in ether-tracked futures reached a record high of $14 billion, accounting for 67% of bitcoin open interest as of Wednesday.\n",

        "Nevertheless, digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare believes that such a challenge is unlikely, stating that passing it through the trading and markets division indicates no opposition from the Commissioners.\n",

Pepe Coin (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Floki (FLOKI) all led cryptocurrency gains. Floki moved 34% higher on crypto exchanges. Pepe went parabolic 110%.\n",
        "Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck launched a Meme Coin Index, a big break for dog money on Wall Street. Meme finance is so hot in May that the original meme stock, Gamestop (NYSE:GME), moved up the chart over 100% this week, after the Reddit WallStreetBets forum member who led its first bull run in Jan. 2021 posted for the first time in three years.\n",

        "And Dogecoin was once a $4.6 billion market cap coin, and Pepe was once a $1.5 billion “joke” blockchain project. So they could be well on their way to greater adoption in the future. Dogs like Dogecoin, Bonk, and Shiba Inu are probably here to stay.\n",
        "But their early return percentages probably are not.\n",
        "The big doge currencies still check out, but they’re older memes now. Unfortunately for crypto investors late to get these pieces into their bags, they have already outgrown the ultra-steep early adoption curves of so many new Internet currencies in the 2020s.\n",
        "Doge coins are simply not secrets anymore, new currencies that start off their product life cycle worth basically $0 on the open crypto exchange market.\n",

        "So if the dog days are over and the frog days are too, where is an impatient altcoin degenerate with a low loss aversion to look for new meme coins that can really take flight?\n",
        "Although this is probably not a strategy a typical financial advisor would recommend, or that you would be likely to find in any classical investing text, and actually sounds totally insane– one way to appraise new meme coins prospects’ is to ask: Would anime fans dig this?\n",
        "Dogecoin was the first meme coin and today it is a Top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap. The effigy gracing the coin and several of its successful peers is the Doge meme from 2013.\n",

        "The Pepe meme, meanwhile, became popular on the 4/chan boards. The power users on this *not safe for work* website are big fans of anime.\n",

        "Immediate resistance levels are at $70,029, $71,458, and $73,299. These levels could act as significant barriers to upward movement. On the downside, support levels are identified at $66,357, $64,947, and $63,490, offering potential buying opportunities if the price continues to decline.\n",

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $68,615, acting as a resistance level close to the pivot point.\n",

        "Police think the international gang ran an “open chat room,” likely a crypto Telegram group or a KakaoTalk open chat, which pretended to offer bona fide crypto trading tips.\n",
        "Instead, officers said, the gang “defrauded 308 investors” out of some $18.8 million.\n",

        "These members allegedly claimed to have made money by following tips they learned in the “reading room.”\n",
        "Per Global Kyungjae Shinmun, the Daegu Police Agency’s criminal task force announced it had made the arrests on May 21.\n",
        "However, the task force thinks at least six suspects are still at large. Police said these individuals are “still overseas.”\n",
        "The task force said it had asked Interpol to issue red notices for all six. This would require overseas police officers to arrest the suspects on sight.\n",

        "This room, police added, was populated with gang members who claimed they had made “big profits” by following advice posted in the room.\n",
        "Victims Lured onto Bogus Crypto Exchanges, Say Police\n",
        "Officers explained that the gang tried to convince room members to download apps connected to crypto exchanges, where they could buy and sell unlisted coins.\n",
        "The group then tried to build trust by ensuring potential victims made moderate gains when they invested minimal amounts of money in these allegedly bogus platforms.\n",
        "In many cases, this convinced victims to increase the value of their stakes. However, when victims tried to make withdrawals from the platforms, gang members told them to pay “withdrawal fees.”\n",
        "When they refused, the gang members would then break off contact, police officers explained. The task force said it was trying to locate the stolen funds.\n",

        "Police said the gang’s ringleader used so-called “pig-butchering” recruitment tactics to increase the size of the gang.\n",

        "The media outlet quoted a lawyer named Kwak Joon-ho as saying:\n",
        "“There has been a sharp rise in fraudulent schemes that make use of open chat rooms, including reading rooms. Perpetrators are likely to face both fraud and organized crime charges.”\n",

        "The courtroom drama unfolded when Gambaryan, Binance’s head of financial crimes compliance, did not immediately step forward to the dock when the case was called. Seated in the back row, he was assisted by his lawyer towards the dock but collapsed en route and had to be sat in the front row.\n",
        "Gambaryan’s lawyer informed the court of his client’s deteriorating health and the submission of a written application notifying the court of his condition.\n",

        "\n",
        "Since February, Gambaryan’s health issues have reportedly worsened. A letter presented to Judge Emeka Nwite highlighted that Gambaryan had broken down and received intravenous treatment for malaria the previous day. Consequently, he was also absent from a tax evasion trial held the day before.\n",
        "Judge Nwite ruled that Gambaryan should receive treatment at the hospital recommended by his lawyer or another designated by prison authorities. The trial has been adjourned to June 20 and 21 to allow Gambaryan’s medical treatment.\n",
        "The case has attracted considerable attention, especially given Nigeria’s ongoing economic challenges. The country has accused Binance of contributing to its currency woes, as Binance and other cryptocurrency platforms have become famous for trading the Nigerian naira amid severe dollar shortages and a plummeting currency.\n",
        "Throughout the proceedings, Gambaryan was visibly weak, leaning on the armrest of his seat.\n",
        "Tax Evasion Charges Against Binance\n",
        "The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has filed tax evasion charges against Binance Holdings Limited and Gambaryan. Due to his absence, however, the trial could not proceed on Wednesday and has now been moved to June 14.\n",
        "Gambaryan, reportedly held at Kuje Prison, did not appear for his scheduled arraignment, confusing the lawyers. Justice Emeka Nwite, overseeing the case, had previously denied Gambaryan’s bail application due to new money laundering charges filed by the EFCC and deemed him a flight risk. The prosecution and defense argued over the failure to ensure Gambaryan’s presence, leading to the adjournment.\n",
        "Gambaryan’s absence from the arraignment session highlighted procedural issues, as his lawyer argued that the prosecution should have ensured his presence given his federal custody status.\n",
        "Anjarwalla, who escaped custody in March, is still involved in the case but has not been officially marked as “at large,” which could complicate proceedings since Nigerian law requires all parties to be served for the case to move forward.\n"

The account made a transaction for the first time since May 2014. The sudden resurgence has sparked fears about the impact of such a transaction on Dogecoin’s price trend.\n",

        "On May 21, Whale Alert revealed another major transaction. The transaction involved shuffling a 600 million DOGE, approximately valued at $100 million, between two unknown wallet addresses. Specifically, the Dogecoin whale transferred 300 million DOGE to each wallet.\n",

        "VanEck, one of the applicants, wasted no time and filed its amended S-1 shortly after receiving approval for the 19b-4 filings. Other applicants are anticipated to follow suit in the near future.\n",
        "However, Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, points out that the SEC’s approval was granted by its Division of Trading and Markets unit under delegated authority. He suggests that one of the five SEC Commissioners could challenge the decision within the next 10 days.\n",
        "Nevertheless, digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare believes that such a challenge is unlikely, stating that passing it through the trading and markets division indicates no opposition from the Commissioners.\n",
        "Regarding market expectations, Seyffart predicts that spot Ether ETFs could attract approximately 20% of the flows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen.\n",
        "On the other hand, Balchunas offers a more conservative estimate of 10-15%.\n",
        "Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs approximately four and a half months ago, they have accumulated $13.3 billion in net inflows, according to Farside Investors.\n",
        "Even capturing 20% of that figure would result in spot Ether ETFs amassing a combined $2.66 billion in inflows over a similar timeframe.\n",

Pepe Coin (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Floki (FLOKI) all led cryptocurrency gains. Floki moved 34% higher on crypto exchanges. Pepe went parabolic 110%.\n",
        "Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck launched a Meme Coin Index, a big break for dog money on Wall Street. Meme finance is so hot in May that the original meme stock, Gamestop (NYSE:GME), moved up the chart over 100% this week, after the Reddit WallStreetBets forum member who led its first bull run in Jan. 2021 posted for the first time in three years.\n",

        "But their early return percentages probably are not.\n",
        "The big doge currencies still check out, but they’re older memes now. Unfortunately for crypto investors late to get these pieces into their bags, they have already outgrown the ultra-steep early adoption curves of so many new Internet currencies in the 2020s.\n",
        "Doge coins are simply not secrets anymore, new currencies that start off their product life cycle worth basically $0 on the open crypto exchange market.\n",

        "So if the dog days are over and the frog days are too, where is an impatient altcoin degenerate with a low loss aversion to look for new meme coins that can really take flight?\n",
        "Although this is probably not a strategy a typical financial advisor would recommend, or that you would be likely to find in any classical investing text, and actually sounds totally insane– one way to appraise new meme coins prospects’ is to ask: Would anime fans dig this?\n",
        "Dogecoin was the first meme coin and today it is a Top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap. The effigy gracing the coin and several of its successful peers is the Doge meme from 2013.\n",

        "Immediate resistance levels are at $70,029, $71,458, and $73,299. These levels could act as significant barriers to upward movement. On the downside, support levels are identified at $66,357, $64,947, and $63,490, offering potential buying opportunities if the price continues to decline.\n",

        "Uncertainty regarding Ethereum’s regulatory situation in the US prompted a lot of traders to short ETH versus other cryptos.\n",
        "The SEC was thought to have been campaigning to classify ETH as a security earlier this year.\n",
        "But now that spot Ethereum ETFs have been approved, that pretty much clears things up. ETH is a digital commodity like Bitcoin.\n",
        "Many shorts need to be unwound and that could be an ongoing tailwind for the market.\n",
        "And cryptocurrencies technicals suggest that since breaking its March to mid-May downtrend and above its 21 and 50DMAs, a retest of March highs near $4,100 is likely.\n",

        "However, the task force thinks at least six suspects are still at large. Police said these individuals are “still overseas.”\n",

        "Victims Lured onto Bogus Crypto Exchanges, Say Police\n",
        "Officers explained that the gang tried to convince room members to download apps connected to crypto exchanges, where they could buy and sell unlisted coins.\n",
        "The group then tried to build trust by ensuring potential victims made moderate gains when they invested minimal amounts of money in these allegedly bogus platforms.\n",
        "In many cases, this convinced victims to increase the value of their stakes. However, when victims tried to make withdrawals from the platforms, gang members told them to pay “withdrawal fees.”\n",

Consequently, he was also absent from a tax evasion trial held the day before.\n",
        "Judge Nwite ruled that Gambaryan should receive treatment at the hospital recommended by his lawyer or another designated by prison authorities. The trial has been adjourned to June 20 and 21 to allow Gambaryan’s medical treatment.\n",
        "The case has attracted considerable attention, especially given Nigeria’s ongoing economic challenges. The country has accused Binance of contributing to its currency woes, as Binance and other cryptocurrency platforms have become famous for trading the Nigerian naira amid severe dollar shortages and a plummeting currency.\n",
        "Throughout the proceedings, Gambaryan was visibly weak, leaning on the armrest of his seat.\n",
        "Tax Evasion Charges Against Binance\n",
        "The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has filed tax evasion charges against Binance Holdings Limited and Gambaryan. Due to his absence, however, the trial could not proceed on Wednesday and has now been moved to June 14.\n",
        "Gambaryan, reportedly held at Kuje Prison, did not appear for his scheduled arraignment, confusing the lawyers. Justice Emeka Nwite, overseeing the case, had previously denied Gambaryan’s bail application due to new money laundering charges filed by the EFCC and deemed him a flight risk. The prosecution and defense argued over the failure to ensure Gambaryan’s presence, leading to the adjournment.\n",
        "Gambaryan’s absence from the arraignment session highlighted procedural issues, as his lawyer argued that the prosecution should have ensured his presence given his federal custody status.\n",
        "Anjarwalla, who escaped custody in March, is still involved in the case but has not been officially marked as “at large,” which could complicate proceedings since Nigerian law requires all parties to be served for the case to move forward.\n"

Previous interactions between the regulatory body and ETF issuers gave little indication of impending approvals, leading to speculation about the catalyst for this sudden shift. Some sources point to recent bipartisan pressure from House lawmakers urging the SEC to align its treatment of Ethereum ETFs with its prior acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n",

        "While Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed huge inflows since their approval, amassing an additional 207,000 Bitcoin ($14 billion) on top of the 621,000 Bitcoin ($42 billion) already held by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust pre-conversion, whether Ethereum ETFs will receive the same level of investor interest is unclear.\n"

        "Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, speaking on the Bankless podcast with Ryan Sean Adams, emphasized that the approval of these commodity-based trust shares implies that the SEC explicitly recognizes Ether as not being a security.\n",

        "This is a key point. The reason the approval of the spot ETH ETFs is a clear indication that the SEC does not consider ETH a security is because funds whose assets are 40% or more securities may not register through a Form S-1; rather, they are considered investment companies and… https://t.co/Q2MkMsrqNg\n",

        "“Today a lot of things probably clearly became commodities, even if they don’t know it yet.”\n",
        "While the approval of spot Ether ETFs reinforces the non-security status of Ether, Seyffart and other experts anticipate that the SEC may still focus on actors involved with staking Ether.\n",

        "It’s worth noting that the SEC’s approval order did not explicitly confirm Ether’s non-security status, leading finance lawyer Scott Johnsson to comment that the issue was “completely sidestepped.”\n",
        "However, an official statement from the SEC and its Commissioners is expected to provide more clarity in the future.\n",

        "The US House on Thursday approved a bill that prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar, or central bank digital currency (CBDC), without explicit authorization from Congress.\n",
        "This legislation, known as the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act (HR 5403), passed with a vote of 216 to 192. Republicans voiced worries that a US CBDC could be used for government control over citizens’ finances.\n",
        "The Fed itself hasn’t yet come out with a solid proposal to launch a digital dollar. But, the House vote reflects ongoing concerns among Republicans – including former President Trump – about potential government overreach with such a system.\n",
        "House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who introduced the legislation, argued a digital dollar could be a “surveillance tool” for the government, giving it the power to track transactions and potentially restrict activity they deem politically undesirable.\n",
        "His stance echoes Trump’s strong opposition to a CBDC, as the current Presidential candidate has vowed to block its creation if re-elected.\n",
        "BREAKING: The House of Representatives just passed our CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act.\n",
        "— Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) May 23, 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "“Such a currency would give the federal government absolute control over your money. They could take your money, and you wouldn’t even know it was gone,” Trump has said.\n",
        "Earlier this week, the American Bankers Association (ABA) urged House leaders to back the bill.\n",
        "House Delivers for Crypto, Denies Fed Power Over Digital Dollar\n",
        "Thursday’s vote marks a significant difference from the prior floor vote. On Wednesday, 71 Democrats and 208 Republicans passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).\n",
        "This bill focuses on a fresh crypto market structure and grants the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission more authority over digital assets in spot markets. It also outlines the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approach towards the sector.\n",
        "Industry Rejoices, But Can FIT21 Pass Biden’s Scrutiny?\n",
        "Wednesday’s vote marks a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It is the first time a bill solely focused on crypto market regulation passed the House. But even though the crypto industry celebrates the FIT21 vote, challenges remain.\n",
        "Alan Mittleman, COO of Secure Digital Markets, told Cryptonews that the bill needs a companion version for the Senate. This new version will need committee revisions and face potential opposition from vocal crypto critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren. In short, the bill’s journey to becoming law is far from over.\n",
        "According to Mittleman, President Joe Biden seems worried that there aren’t enough consumer protections in FIT21. “He hasn’t threatened a veto yet. But that suggests more work may be required on the bill to go through,” he added.\n"

        "Bitcoin’s current market position has sparked renewed interest in Bitcoin price prediction. Trading at $67,836.31 with a 24-hour trading volume of $42.4 billion, Bitcoin has dipped 2.27% in the last 24 hours.\n",
        "As the leading cryptocurrency with a market cap of $1.3 trillion, its movements are closely watched, with traders focusing on key resistance and support levels to gauge future price trends.\n",
        "Bitcoin Price Prediction\n",
        "Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading at $67,835, down 2.25% over the past 24 hours, signalling a bearish Bitcoin price prediction. The green line at $68,263 serves as the pivot point, which is crucial for determining the trend direction.\n",
        "Immediate resistance levels are at $70,029, $71,458, and $73,299. These levels could act as significant barriers to upward movement. On the downside, support levels are identified at $66,357, $64,947, and $63,490, offering potential buying opportunities if the price continues to decline.\n",
        "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.35, indicating that Bitcoin is approaching oversold conditions, which could suggest a potential reversal or stabilization around this level. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $68,615, acting as a resistance level close to the pivot point.\n",
        "Technically, Bitcoin shows signs of potential bearish movement as it trades below the pivot point. An entry strategy would be to sell below $68,263, targeting a take-profit level of $66,357 and setting a stop loss at $70,029.\n",
        "This approach leverages the potential for further decline while managing risk.\n",
        "Conclusion: Bitcoin’s current price action suggests a bearish outlook as it trades below the pivot point of $68,263. Immediate resistance levels are at $70,030, $71,450, and $73,300, while support levels are at $66,357, $64,947, and $63,490.\n",

        "The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act’s (FIT21) approval on Wednesday would align the US with other nations in terms of its regulatory framework for crypto, according to Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the Chamber of Progress.\n",
        "Bligen told Cryptonews in an interview Thursday that if the FIT21 bill passes the Senate and becomes law, it would stop crypto companies from leaving the US for countries with clearer regulations.\n",
        "The legislation would provide increased freedoms to cryptocurrency operators in the US. Additionally, it would shift more regulatory responsibility for digital assets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n",
        "It would also make it clear which businesses the SEC and CFTC regulate and would create a system for registering these businesses. This would allow them to legally serve customers who want to buy and sell digital assets. The SEC would oversee digital assets that are considered securities, while the CFTC would oversee things like commodities and derivatives related to digital assets.\n",
        "Outdated Law Hinders US Crypto Regulation\n",
        "Bligen pointed out the fact that the US has been using a nearly century-old law, the Howey Test, from the SEC to regulate cryptocurrency that was invented just a few years ago. He argued that the current system is outdated and doesn’t work for this technology.\n",
        "“Hopefully this [bill] establishes the US as a regulatory leader that wants strong consumer protections,” he said. “We already have the most liquid, most attractive capital markets in the US. There’s no reason why we can’t have the best cryptocurrency markets as well.”\n",
        "FIT21 Seen as Crypto Talent Retainer\n",
        "Harry Sudock, chief strategy officer at Bitcoin miner GRIID, agrees that the bill would propel the US to a competitive position in the international crypto scene. Additionally, he believes FIT21 would incentivize the brightest minds in crypto to come to and stay in the US.\n",
        "“We’ve seen a number of businesses either leave the US or decline to do business here thanks to regulatory uncertainty,” he said. “FIT21 will help those businesses return to the US, but the bill is really only just the start.”\n",
        "FIT21’s House Hurdle Cleared, Senate Showdown Looms\n",
        "FIT21’s journey to becoming law isn’t over yet. While it successfully cleared the House, it still faces an uphill battle. The bill needs to be approved by the Senate and then signed by the President before it becomes law. Whether the Senate will give it the green light remains to be seen.\n",
        "Ronen Cojocaru, CEO of automated crypto trading platform 8081, highlighted the unique challenges crypto bills face in the Senate. Some senators are familiar with the technology and may be vocal supporters or opponents of the FIT21 Act. However, others might lack a deep understanding of the intricacies of cryptocurrency, making them undecided on the bill’s merits.\n",
        "“Public opinion and upcoming elections influence Senators’ decisions, aligning them with their party’s agenda and voter interests,” he said. “Senators can use a filibuster, requiring 60 votes to advance the bill, which is tough without strong bipartisan support.”\n",
        "Cojocaru also explained why the US is currently lagging behind other countries. He pointed to Switzerland, nicknamed “Crypto Valley,” as a prime example. Switzerland’s financial regulator, FINMA, fosters innovation by providing clear guidelines for crypto businesses, making it a global hub for the industry.\n",
        "Singapore has also attracted many crypto companies with its well-defined regulations and supportive policies. Its central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has struck a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding consumers. Similarly, Malta, known as the “Blockchain Island,” has become a magnet for crypto businesses with its comprehensive and crypto-friendly regulations.\n",
        "CFTC vs. SEC in Regulating Crypto\n",
        "Meanwhile, James Koutoulas founder at Typhon Capital Management, said FIT21 needs some work, especially for DeFi. Additionally, he highlighted the unprecedented power it gives the CFTC to regulate crypto as a spot commodity, which falls outside its usual domain of regulating commodity derivatives.\n",
        "“But, at least at the present time, the CFTC is infinitely less hostile to crypto than the SEC and seems focused on implementing regulatory pathways instead of maliciously attacking market leaders without the statutory authority to do so like the SEC,” Koutoulas said.\n"

        "The recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially confirms Ether’s status as a non-security, according to industry experts.\n",
        "Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, speaking on the Bankless podcast with Ryan Sean Adams, emphasized that the approval of these commodity-based trust shares implies that the SEC explicitly recognizes Ether as not being a security.\n",

        "This is a key point. The reason the approval of the spot ETH ETFs is a clear indication that the SEC does not consider ETH a security is because funds whose assets are 40% or more securities may not register through a Form S-1; rather, they are considered investment companies and… https://t.co/Q2MkMsrqNg\n",

        "“Today a lot of things probably clearly became commodities, even if they don’t know it yet.”\n",
        "While the approval of spot Ether ETFs reinforces the non-security status of Ether, Seyffart and other experts anticipate that the SEC may still focus on actors involved with staking Ether.\n",

        "For the past 30 days ending May 14, meme coin prices surged despite the overall market continuing to capitulate from mid-March highs following Bitcoin notching a two-year plus all-time record price high. Pepe Coin (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Floki (FLOKI) all led cryptocurrency gains. Floki moved 34% higher on crypto exchanges. Pepe went parabolic 110%.\n",
        "Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck launched a Meme Coin Index, a big break for dog money on Wall Street. Meme finance is so hot in May that the original meme stock, Gamestop (NYSE:GME), moved up the chart over 100% this week, after the Reddit WallStreetBets forum member who led its first bull run in Jan. 2021 posted for the first time in three years.\n",
        "Meme Coins: Are The Dog Days Over?\n",
        "As theCryptoBubbles.net graphic above shows, the ROI is coming in dank this year:\n",
        "When it first launched just last year, PEPE boldly predicted, “The Dog Days Are Over.”\n",
        "Not that e-currencies like Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, and Bonk are going anywhere. With potentially millions of users and market capitalizations of $21 billion, $4.6 billion, and $1.5 billion for these three coins, respectively, they’re now small economies in their own right.\n",
        "And Dogecoin was once a $4.6 billion market cap coin, and Pepe was once a $1.5 billion “joke” blockchain project. So they could be well on their way to greater adoption in the future. Dogs like Dogecoin, Bonk, and Shiba Inu are probably here to stay.\n",
        "But their early return percentages probably are not.\n",
        "The big doge currencies still check out, but they’re older memes now. Unfortunately for crypto investors late to get these pieces into their bags, they have already outgrown the ultra-steep early adoption curves of so many new Internet currencies in the 2020s.\n",
        "Doge coins are simply not secrets anymore, new currencies that start off their product life cycle worth basically $0 on the open crypto exchange market.\n",
        "Early investor returns on the most successful projects in meme currency are so unbelievable that most people won’t bother to pounce on these opportunities even though they absurdly outperform Bitcoin and most stocks.\n",
        "The Best Kept Secret In Crypto Altcoin Markets\n",
        "After just 12 months on the market, PEPE may already be a conservative investment that cannot deliver the kind of moonshot price launches that successful new projects can.\n",
        "So if the dog days are over and the frog days are too, where is an impatient altcoin degenerate with a low loss aversion to look for new meme coins that can really take flight?\n",
        "Although this is probably not a strategy a typical financial advisor would recommend, or that you would be likely to find in any classical investing text, and actually sounds totally insane– one way to appraise new meme coins prospects’ is to ask: Would anime fans dig this?\n",
        "Dogecoin was the first meme coin and today it is a Top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap. The effigy gracing the coin and several of its successful peers is the Doge meme from 2013.\n",
        "The Shiba Inu is a popular Japanese dog breed, so anime fans love it.\n",
        "The Pepe meme, meanwhile, became popular on the 4/chan boards. The power users on this *not safe for work* website are big fans of anime.\n",
        "One theory gaining traction in the altcoin community in Q2 2024 is that cat memes are up next for adorable big launches and super cute enormous rallies.\n",

        "One new meme coin project with a cat meme denomination, Kai Cat (KAI) on Ethereum is in presale in May. It’s the last chance altcoin gem hunters have to buy the coin at the same fixed price before it starts fluctuating as investors trade it on multi-billion crypto liquidity markets.\n",

        "The US House on Thursday approved a bill that prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar, or central bank digital currency (CBDC), without explicit authorization from Congress.\n",
        "This legislation, known as the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act (HR 5403), passed with a vote of 216 to 192. Republicans voiced worries that a US CBDC could be used for government control over citizens’ finances.\n",
        "The Fed itself hasn’t yet come out with a solid proposal to launch a digital dollar. But, the House vote reflects ongoing concerns among Republicans – including former President Trump – about potential government overreach with such a system.\n",
        "House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who introduced the legislation, argued a digital dollar could be a “surveillance tool” for the government, giving it the power to track transactions and potentially restrict activity they deem politically undesirable.\n",
        "His stance echoes Trump’s strong opposition to a CBDC, as the current Presidential candidate has vowed to block its creation if re-elected.\n",
        "BREAKING: The House of Representatives just passed our CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act.\n",
        "— Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) May 23, 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "“Such a currency would give the federal government absolute control over your money. They could take your money, and you wouldn’t even know it was gone,” Trump has said.\n",
        "Earlier this week, the American Bankers Association (ABA) urged House leaders to back the bill.\n",
        "House Delivers for Crypto, Denies Fed Power Over Digital Dollar\n",
        "Thursday’s vote marks a significant difference from the prior floor vote. On Wednesday, 71 Democrats and 208 Republicans passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).\n",
        "This bill focuses on a fresh crypto market structure and grants the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission more authority over digital assets in spot markets. It also outlines the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approach towards the sector.\n",
        "Industry Rejoices, But Can FIT21 Pass Biden’s Scrutiny?\n",
        "Wednesday’s vote marks a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It is the first time a bill solely focused on crypto market regulation passed the House. But even though the crypto industry celebrates the FIT21 vote, challenges remain.\n",
        "Alan Mittleman, COO of Secure Digital Markets, told Cryptonews that the bill needs a companion version for the Senate. This new version will need committee revisions and face potential opposition from vocal crypto critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren. In short, the bill’s journey to becoming law is far from over.\n",
        "According to Mittleman, President Joe Biden seems worried that there aren’t enough consumer protections in FIT21. “He hasn’t threatened a veto yet. But that suggests more work may be required on the bill to go through,” he added.\n"
