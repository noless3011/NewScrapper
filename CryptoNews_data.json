        "Newly-approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could potentially hit the market by mid-June.\n",
        "Following the successful 19b-4 filings for spot Ether ETFs, which allow them to be listed on exchanges, the next step is to obtain approved S-1 registration statements before trading can commence.\n",
        "Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart predicts that the S-1 approvals could be granted in a ‚Äúcouple of weeks,‚Äù although he acknowledges that the process may take longer, typically spanning up to five months.\n",
        "However, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a mid-June launch is certainly possible.\n",
        "Balchunas expects a single round of comments to the S-1 amendments, similar to the feedback provided for spot Bitcoin ETF applicants, which could facilitate a quicker approval timeline.\n",
        "The imp part is over. Now just logistics. My guess is there‚Äôs only one round of comments on the S-1s. And during btc one round took two weeks ish. So I this mid June is certainly poss. Just a guess tho. We will see.\n",
        "‚Äî Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 23, 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "VanEck Files Amended S-1\n",
        "VanEck, one of the applicants, wasted no time and filed its amended S-1 shortly after receiving approval for the 19b-4 filings. Other applicants are anticipated to follow suit in the near future.\n",
        "However, Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, points out that the SEC‚Äôs approval was granted by its Division of Trading and Markets unit under delegated authority. He suggests that one of the five SEC Commissioners could challenge the decision within the next 10 days.\n",
        "Nevertheless, digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare believes that such a challenge is unlikely, stating that passing it through the trading and markets division indicates no opposition from the Commissioners.\n",
        "Regarding market expectations, Seyffart predicts that spot Ether ETFs could attract approximately 20% of the flows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen.\n",
        "On the other hand, Balchunas offers a more conservative estimate of 10-15%.\n",
        "Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs approximately four and a half months ago, they have accumulated $13.3 billion in net inflows, according to Farside Investors.\n",
        "Even capturing 20% of that figure would result in spot Ether ETFs amassing a combined $2.66 billion in inflows over a similar timeframe.\n",
        "Grayscale Ethereum Trust Could See Outflows\n",
        "However, concerns have arisen around potential outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust if investors shift their holdings to spot Ether ETFs, mirroring the outflows witnessed with the conversion of Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin investment product.\n",
        "The Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently holds over $11.3 billion in assets, as reported by Arkham Intelligence.\n",
        "On May 23, regulatory approval was granted to eight applicants, including VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Bitwise, and Invesco Galaxy.\n",
        "One ETF issuer, Hashdex, did not receive approval on that particular day, standing as the exception.\n",
        "As reported, Singapore-based QCP Capital believes the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States could potentially trigger a substantial rally of up to 60% in the price of ETH.\n",
        "QCP Capital pointed out that when spot bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, Bitcoin experienced a significant surge from $42,000 to over $73,000 within a two-week period after the ETFs began trading.\n",
        "‚ÄúWith Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,‚Äù QCP Capital stated.\n"

        "Communities across the web are pausing to reflect on the life of Kabosu, the dog behind the Doge meme and Dogecoin mascot, who passed away at 17 on May 25.\n",
        "Kabosu‚Äôs owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the news in a post on her official blog, expressing her deep gratitude for the love and support shown to her over the years.\n",
        "The passing came following an announcement that Kabosu was in a ‚Äúdangerous position‚Äù healthwise in 2022. However, Sata expressed the passing to be peaceful, without suffering.\n",
        "‚ÄúSoft light streamed in through the window, amidst the beautiful morning where birds sing, she gently passed away, as if falling asleep, while being stroked by me,‚Äù she said.\n",

        "Doge‚Äôs History: From Meme, to Crypto, to Legend\n",
        "Kabosu first gained widespread attention in 2010 when Sato shared photos of her adopted dog on her blog. A particular image of Kabosu, capturing her skeptical and curious expression, swiftly went viral and birthed the ‚ÄúDoge‚Äù meme phenomenon.\n",
        "\n",
        "This single image, accompanied by phrases in broken English, became a cornerstone of early meme culture.\n",
        "By 2013, the popularity of the foundational meme surged after Dogecoin was created, using Kabosu‚Äôs image as its official logo.\n",
        "Despite initially being intended as a joke, Dogecoin became a popular cryptocurrency. It became responsible for several charitable initiatives, including clean water projects and funding for the Jamaican bobsled team.\n",
        "This also normalized meme coins in the crypto space, resulting in the rise of some of the most popular meme coins. Many of these coins adopted the Shiba Inu as their mascot, paying homage to the original meme that sparked the trend.\n",
        "The original Doge image was also minted as an NFT in 2023. It sold for 1,696 ETH, worth $4 million.\n",
        "Since being sold, the NFT has been divided into billions of smaller, tradable units for fractional ownership.\n",
        "Her influence extends to political campaigns. For example, United States President Joe Biden‚Äôs reelection campaign announced hiring a ‚Äúmaster of memes‚Äù on May 23.\n",
        "The Crypto Community Commemorates Kabo\n",
        "The crypto community and fans of Kabosu have expressed their condolences, sharing tributes and favorite memories of the dog that became an internet legend.\n",
        "The official Shiba Inu token, competitor to Dogecoin, tweeted a heartfelt tribute underscoring Kabosu‚Äôs impact on crypto.\n",

        "Kabosu‚Äôs legacy as the face of crypto culture will continue to symbolize community spirit and inspire future generations of meme enthusiasts.\n"

In 2023, data indicated that the UAE accounted for around 400 megawatts of Bitcoin mining capacity, representing 4% of the global hash rate. This makes the UAE one of the leading Bitcoin mining hubs in the Middle East, demonstrating a favorable environment for crypto activities outside of agricultural contexts.\n",

The UAE leads the region in adoption per capita, with peak daily active users reaching 106,111 in 2024. Despite its larger population, Saudi Arabia has slightly higher peak daily active users.\n",
        "The growth in adoption is attributed to evolving views on how crypto aligns with Islamic beliefs, with attitudes changing as cryptocurrencies become more regulated.\n",

        "English artist Damien Hirst is under increased scrutiny this week following claims he backdated more than 1,000 pieces of art from his NFT project ‚ÄúThe Currency,‚Äù The Guardian reported Wednesday.\n",
        "Damian Hirst Under Fire For NFT Project Following Expos√©\n",
        "The controversial artist, perhaps best known for works depicting animals preserved in formaldehyde, allegedly misrepresented the actual dates of an estimated 10% of the 10,000 physical paintings from ‚ÄúThe Currency,‚Äù all of which corresponded to a matching NFT.\n",
        "Launched in 2021 and sold for $2000, Hirst claimed that all of the physical paintings part of the NFT project were made by hand in 2016.\n",
        "Sources that spoke to The Guardian claimed that, in actuality, the dotted paintings were mass-produced by nearly a dozen artists in 2018 and 2019 in the U.K. on a ‚ÄúHenry Ford production line.‚Äù\n",
        "More Damien Hirst artworks created years later than claimed, investigation finds https://t.co/075Ly2JVU3 #nft #nftnews #nfts\n",

        "‚ÄúIt was very, very tedious,‚Äù one source told The Guardian. ‚ÄúThere were loads of sheets on these tables, and they were quite low so you had to bend down to do the spots. After a while some people were getting repetitive strain injuries.‚Äù\n",
        "Footage featuring multiple paintings recorded from inside Hirst‚Äôs studio in 2019 and verified by the media outlet confirms the allegations.\n",
        "Lawyers for Hirst did not deny the claims, stating that the 2016 marker represents the conceptual date of Hirst‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Currency‚Äù rather than each painting‚Äôs physical production date.\n",

        "Purchasers of ‚ÄúThe Currency‚Äù were allowed to keep either the physical painting or its digital twin, but not both. In 2022, Hirst burned the physical versions of those who selected the NFT to effectively transfer each painting‚Äôs value digitally.\n",
        "‚ÄúA lot of people think I‚Äôm burning millions of dollars of art but I‚Äôm not,‚Äù Hirst told the BBC at the time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm completing the transformation of these physical artworks into NFTs by burning the physical versions.‚Äù\n",

        "If true, the allegations may damage Hirst‚Äôs already-scrutinized reputation, question the legitimacy of his works, and potentially lower the value of his NFT project.\n"

        "Traditional banks may still dominate the financial industry in terms of assets held, but credit unions are becoming an increasingly popular option for Americans who qualify.\n",
        "Recent data shows that there are roughly 4,600 credit unions in the United States. A September 2023 report from The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) further notes that nearly 139 million Americans were members of federally insured credit unions, up 20% from five years prior.\n",

        "Credit Unions Are Ripe For Tokenization of Real World Assets\n",
        "John Wingate, Chief Executive of financial platform BankSocial, told Cryptonews that a credit union is a member owned bank.\n",
        "‚ÄúUnlike for profit banks that are owned by shareholders, credit unions are owned by the members, one member, one share, one vote,‚Äù said Wingate. ‚ÄúGiven this, the credit union ethos and the decentralized fiance (DeFi) ethos are perfectly aligned.‚Äù\n",

        "Kyle Hauptman, Vice Chairman of the NCUA ‚Äì an independent U.S. government agency that regulates federal credit unions ‚Äì told Cryptonews that credit unions buy and sell pieces of loans.\n",
        "‚ÄúThis is a clunky process called ‚Äòloan participations,‚Äù said Hauptman.\n",
        "A compliance blog from the National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions explained that loan participation occurs whenever the ownership interests in a loan are divided up and sold.\n",
        "‚ÄúUnder section 701.22, federally insured credit unions (FICUs) can buy participation interests in loans under certain conditions,‚Äù the blog states.\n",
        "Hauptman pointed out that the current loan participation process can be complex. For example, he explained that if a credit union makes a loan and another credit union buys a 20% stake in it, it gets 20% of every loan payment.\n",
        "Hauptman noted that the credit union that buys participation in the loan doesn‚Äôt know if the payment has actually been made, however. Additionally, that credit union is unsure if the selling credit union will pay the required 20%.\n",
        "‚ÄúThis makes it difficult for the buying credit union to plan, and it creates unnecessary uncertainty,‚Äù said Hauptman.\n",
        "Tokenization Use Cases\n",
        "Considering the challenge, Hauptman believes that tokenizing loans that aren‚Äôt big enough to be securitized in a bond offering may be helpful.\n",
        "‚ÄúA smart contract would automatically pay the buying credit union their 20%,‚Äù said Hauptman. ‚ÄúThat credit union will never have to ask ‚Äòdid they make a payment?‚Äô or ‚Äòwhen do I get my piece?.‚Äô‚Äù\n",
        "Ravi de Silva, Managing Partner at compliance risk management firm de Risk Partners, told Cryptonews that tokenization could also help manage compliance risk by providing greater transparency, security, and efficiency.\n",
        "For example, de Silva believes that tokenization would be helpful for credit unions and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) use cases.\n",
        "‚ÄúTransaction monitoring is a key control requirement in AML, which involves analyzing customer transactional data to identify potential suspicious or fraudulent activities,‚Äù de Silva said. ‚ÄúTokenization can enable efficient analysis of transactional data.‚Äù\n",
        "For instance, de Silva remarked that tokens can be used as a unique identifier to track transactional patterns and detect anomalies. He added that credit unions can analyze token data to detect large cash transactions, structuring or unusual transaction patterns.\n",
        "‚ÄúAML regulations also require financial institutions, including credit unions, to perform thorough customer due diligence and maintain accurate records of their customers‚Äô identities,‚Äù de Silva mentioned.\n",
        "Therefore, he believes tokenization can further help securely store and reference customer identification data.\n",
        "Credit Unions Adopt Tokenization\n",
        "Given the benefits that tokenization can bring to credit unions, it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that some have started implementing these solutions.\n",
        "According to Wingate, BankSocial is working with several credit unions for use cases such as tokenizing identity.\n",
        "‚ÄúCredit unions are using our ‚Äòverified product‚Äô for interoperable use between systems and fintechs, deposits for interoperability between bank accounts, other banks, and for DeFi use cases,‚Äù he said.\n",

        "‚ÄúThis is done in a quantum resistant way, on-chain, to provide immutability to records and outcomes for regulators and third party audits,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have future cases in the pipeline for merchant payments, treasury management, and lending/borrowing.‚Äù\n",
        "Wingate added that Great Lakes Credit Union recently implemented BankSocial‚Äôs Real Time Payment Solution. The solution uses Hedera Hashgraph‚Äôs distributed ledger technology (DLT) to tokenize payments and deposits for peer-to-peer transactions made on the Hedera network.\n",

        "Credit Unions Embrace Tokenization, But Concerns Remain\n",
        "While it‚Äôs notable that some credit unions have begun exploring tokenization use cases, regulatory concerns are a constant challenge.\n",
        "According to Hauptman, the big question that credit unions face is whether or not tokens are securities.\n",
        "‚ÄúCredit unions worry if that participation may be deemed a security,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe at NCUA have cleared the way for tokenization use, but we can‚Äôt really assuage other concerns about the tokens themselves.‚Äù\n",
        "Hauptman added that KYC processes, along with which platforms custody tokens, is a concern for credit unions.\n",
        "‚ÄúAnd then within the platform the concern is ‚Äòwho are the node operators?‚Äô‚Äù Hauptman pointed out. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs already been political questions about a node being in North Korea or Iran. No one needs an OFAC investigation for breaking sanctions.‚Äù\n",
        "On a positive note, Hauptman shared that credit unions are moving forward with blockchain projects that enable identification.\n",
        "‚ÄúThis is where any token is clearly not something ever ‚Äòbought or sold,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut tokenization for real world assets remains an issue.‚Äù\n",
        "Yet, all things considered, Hauptman believes that U.S. credit unions are still better off implementing tokenization use cases than U.S. banks. He believes this is because NCUA has delivered guidance that provides positive clarity around regulations for credit unions.\n",
        "For example, Hauptman noted that in July 2021, NCUA published a ‚ÄúRequest for Information and Comment on Digital Assets and Related Technologies‚Äù report. Later that year, NCUA released a report called ‚ÄúGuidance on Relationships with Third Parties that Provide Services Related to Digital Assets.‚Äù Additionally, in May 2022, NCUA released another document called ‚ÄúGuidance on Federally Insured Credit Union Use of Distributed Ledger Technologies.‚Äù\n",
        "Credit Unions Should Work With Compliance Teams\n",
        "In addition to clear guidance, de Silva believes that the regulatory challenges of implementing tokens can be solved by demonstrating how tokenization is implemented, monitored, and audited.\n",
        "‚ÄúCredit unions need to continuously monitor their tokenization processes and conduct regular risk assessments to identify and address any vulnerabilities or emerging threats,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis includes staying updated on the evolving regulatory landscape and making necessary adjustments to ensure compliance.‚Äù\n",
        "Given this, de Silva pointed out that credit unions should work closely with compliance teams to adopt industry best practices for tokenization.\n",
        "‚ÄúIt is essential to establish a robust framework that aligns tokenization practices with applicable regulations, while prioritizing the security and privacy of customer data,‚Äù he said.\n"

        "\n",
        "In some cases, some miners may connect 10 mining rigs to the mining pool, while other miners may only connect 1. How can this unequal contribution be fairly distributed in the mining pool for mining rewards?\n",
        "To fairly distribute miners‚Äô rewards, since the inception of the first mining pool in 2010, over 10 different payment models have emerged in the market. Nowadays, the mainstream payment models can be roughly categorized into 5 types: PPS, PPS+, PPLNS, FPPS, and SOLO. Among them, PPS+ and PPLNS are the two most commonly used payment models at present.\n",
        "What is PPS+(Pay Per Share+)?\n",
        "PPS+ is a payment model introduced by ViaBTC Pool in August 2016 as an improvement to the traditional PPS payment model. Based on PPS, PPS+ additionally allocates transaction fees. Specifically, coinbase rewards are distributed according to the PPS payment model, while transaction fees are distributed according to the PPLNS payment model (which will be discussed later).\n",
        "In a mining pool, a share represents a possible solution to a hashing problem that miners submit to the mining pool, serving as proof of their contribution. The hashrate of a mining rig indicates the number of possible solutions it can generate per second. For instance, a mining rig with a hashrate of 200 TH/s can submit two quadrillion shares per second. Under the PPS payment model, miners receive rewards for each share they submit, regardless of whether the mining pool successfully mines a block.\n",
        "Additionally, under the PPS+ payment model, extra transaction fees are allocated based on the transaction fees included in the blocks mined by the mining pool according to the PPLNS.\n",
        "The core of this payment model lies in its stability and predictability. Regardless of fluctuations in the mining pool‚Äôs luck, miners can enjoy consistent mining income.\n",
        "What is PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares)?\n",
        "PPLNS is a payment model based on the most recent N shares. Miners‚Äô earnings depend on the valid shares they contribute when the mining pool successfully mines a block.\n",
        "Mining pools do not calculate the corresponding earnings immediately when miners submit possible solutions (share), but instead, after receiving every N shares, they tally the total rewards obtained by the mining pool from mining blocks during that period (including coinbase rewards and transaction fee rewards). Then, based on the proportion of shares submitted by each miner within these N shares, the rewards for that period are distributed.\n",
        "For example, suppose a mining pool successfully mines a block after receiving N\u003d200,000 shares. At this point, the mining pool immediately calculates the proportion of each participant‚Äôs shares within the last N shares. If Miner A contributed 200 shares out of these 200,000 shares, Miner A would receive a portion of the Coinbase reward as follows: 3.125 √ó 200 / 200,000 \u003d 0.003125 BTC (excluding any fees deducted by the pool). Simultaneously, the transaction fees generated by this block would also be distributed based on Miner A‚Äôs share contribution.\n",
        "Compared to PPS+, the PPLNS payment model is more volatile, with mining rewards for miners potentially being either high or low.\n",

          "description": ""
        },
        "How to Choose the Best Payment Model?\n",
        "Regardless of which mining pool a miner chooses to join, they must first set the payment model before the mining rig starts operating. So, how do you choose the most suitable payment model for yourself? The premise is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each model. Here‚Äôs a summary:\n",
        "Preference for stable income miners: If you value income stability and predictability more, PPS+ might be the more suitable choice. PPS+ can provide a continuous fixed return, suitable for miners who are unwilling to take on significant risks.\n",
        "Miners willing to take risks for higher returns: If you can tolerate income fluctuations and seek higher potential returns through mining, then PPLNS may be more suitable for you. PPLNS can yield higher rewards when blocks are successfully mined, suitable for miners willing to commit long-term and have confidence in the mining pool.\n",
        "Mainstream cryptos and their associated payment models that major mining pools\n",
        "The entities chosen are: AntPool, ViaBTC, F2Pool, Binance Pool, and EMCDPool.\n",
        "\n",
        "ViaBTC has recently implemented the PPS+ payment model in the KAS mining pool, providing KAS miners who join the ViaBTC Pool with the option to select PPS+ as their payment mode.\n",
        "About ViaBTC\n",
        "ViaBTC, founded in May 2016, has provided professional, efficient, safe and stable crypto mining services for over one million users in 130+ countries/regions around the world, with a cumulative mining output value of tens of billions of dollars.

        "The ongoing presale of BlastUP is a huge success, more than $6 million raised so far. The BlastUP token is considered by crypto experts as a hidden crypto gem that can skyrocket 1000% by the end of this year.\n",

        "Starknet Price Analysis: Steady Growth with Volatility\n",
        "Starknet (STRK) has seen a notable rise of 499.50% over the last six months, indicating strong investor interest. In the short term, the coin‚Äôs price has experienced some fluctuations, as seen with a decrease of 9.51% over the past month. In the last week, the price edged up by 1.42%. STRK is currently moving in a range between $0.99 and $1.17. With the RSI at 45.42, the coin does not show signs of being overbought or oversold. The movement appears moderate without clear signs of strong impulse or correction for now.\n",
        "Blur (BLUR) Price Movement and Future Outlook\n",
        "Blur‚Äôs current price is floating between $0.33 and $0.38 with recent downward pressure seen as the coin has fallen 5.84% in the past month and 36.93% over the last six months. Its nearest resistance and support levels stand at $0.41 and $0.31 respectively. Blur‚Äôs price moves lately seem corrective as the indicators like the RSI at 44.69 and a low Stochastic value at 27.61 suggest the absence of strong buyer momentum. Despite a significant drop over the last week with a 10.40% increase, the coin‚Äôs Simple Moving Averages (10-days at $0.42 and 100-days at $0.40) hint that Blur might see a potential uptick if it can overcome the immediate resistance levels, aiming for the second resistance level at $0.46.\n",
        "Arbitrum Price Movement: What‚Äôs Next for ARB?\n",
        "Arbitrum‚Äôs (ARB) trading price has seen varied changes, with a recent range from $0.91 to $1.06. After an 18.90% rise in the last week, the price faced a slight drop of 2.32% over the past month. Compared to six months ago, the current price shows a 12.53% improvement. ARB is now swinging between efforts to push higher and moves to stabilize, which suggests it might be in a corrective phase. The coin‚Äôs simple moving averages signal a potentially bullish trend, as the 10-day average ($1.19) is higher than the 100-day ($1.11). Indicators like RSI at 52.45 hint that ARB is in a balanced zone, neither overbought nor oversold. With Stochastic and MACD levels showing room for movement, ARB could be aiming for the nearest resistance at $1.14, unless selling pressure pushes it towards the support at $0.84.\n",
        "Sei Coin: Mild Turbulence in Short Term as Long-term Shines\n",
        "SEI has seen a price dip recently, with a 2.77% fall in the past week and a sharper 20.38% drop over the past month. However, it remains well above where it was six months ago, boasting a strong 111.05% gain. Currently trading between $0.45 and $0.59, SEI faces the next hurdle at a $0.67 resistance level, while support holds at $0.37. The coin is in a corrective phase, as suggested by indicators like the RSI at a low 30.51 and a Stochastic level of 14.68, signaling it may be oversold. The MACD just below zero confirms this corrective trend.\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "In the bustling market, STRK, BLUR, ARB, and SEI might not shine as brightly in the short-term. The real standout is BlastUP, poised to rise above the rest. This project is impressive due to its innovative concept and its integration with the Blast ecosystem. Those looking for noteworthy growth potential would be wise to consider the merits of BlastUP as a key contender for significant returns.\n",

        "The syndicate also resorted to converting cryptocurrencies into cash through unregistered money changers, effectively evading detection by law enforcement agencies.\n",

        "\n",
        "According to Bloomberg reports, Jian Wen, a former fast-food worker, has been sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for laundering significant amounts of Bitcoin associated with a US$5.6 billion investment fraud in China. The case saw Wen convicted of money laundering linked to approximately 150 Bitcoin for a Chinese woman between 2017 and 2022. Law enforcement authorities seized over 61,000 Bitcoin valued at over US$4 billion.\n",
        "During Friday‚Äôs sentencing, Judge Sally-Ann Hales remarked that the offense was sophisticated and involved substantial planning, stating, ‚ÄúI am in no doubt that you knew what you were dealing with.‚Äù\n",
        "Despite holding British and Chinese citizenship, Wen consistently denied all allegations against her and is currently appealing her conviction. She portrayed herself as a victim who merely followed instructions from a woman, insisting she was unaware of the funds‚Äô fraudulent origins. Her lawyers further portrayed Wen Jian as another victim of the mastermind behind the fraud, labeling the individual as an ‚Äúexpert criminal supervillain‚Äù who exploited Wen Jian‚Äôs trustworthiness before discarding her.\n",
        "However, the prosecution argued that Wen was motivated by greed and financial gain, asserting she played a decisive role in managing the crypto wallet linked to the laundering scheme. Prosecutors described Wen Jian as a ‚Äúfront person‚Äù utilized by the fraud mastermind to convert stolen funds into bitcoin, move them out of China, and convert them back into cash.\n",
        "Wen Jian maintained her innocence, claiming she was simply trying to provide a better life for her son, denying three counts of money laundering, and claiming she did not know Bitcoin‚Äôs criminal origins. Despite her claims, jurors found her guilty of one count in March, while two other counts resulted in a hung jury.\n",
        "In March, a jury found Wen guilty of one count of money laundering after a trial that spanned nearly two months, during which thousands of pieces of evidence, including WhatsApp messages between Wen and the alleged mastermind, were presented.\n",
        "Wen Jian Sentenced to Six Years and Eight Months for Money Laundering in High-Profile Fraud Case\n",
        "Wen, 42, experienced a dramatic transformation in her lifestyle, transitioning from living in the basement of an east London Chinese takeaway to residing in a six-bedroom mansion in a leafy suburb and indulging in luxury shopping sprees at Harrods after she began working for the now-arrested female fugitive. Judge Hales noted, ‚ÄúI am in no doubt that you came to enjoy the better things in life.‚Äù\n",
        "In a separate statement, Wen‚Äôs lawyer refuted the allegations of fraud against her, asserting that she acquired substantial holdings of Bitcoin through lawful means.\n",
        "Judge Sally-Ann Hales emphasized that while there was no evidence of Wen Jian‚Äôs involvement in the underlying fraud but she was aware she was dealing with criminal proceeds. She sentenced Wen Jian to six years and eight months in prison for a single count of money laundering.\n",
        "Recently, the EU passed a new anti-money laundering regulation (AMLR) aimed at regulating crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). This regulation empowers Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to detect and combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n",
        "The legislation package, announced on Wednesday, will impact crypto exchanges and brokers operating under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). These laws introduce ‚Äúenhanced due diligence measures,‚Äù requiring obligated entities such as crypto-asset managers to report suspicious activities to FIUs.\n",
        "Also, a new supervisory body, AMLA, will oversee implementation. This broad AML/CFT framework applies to all financial institutions, including CASPs, and is not specific to crypto.\n"

        "\n",
        "With the Ethereum ETF approval speculations triggering a rally for Ether, the Ethereum ERC20 tokens are already heading to the moon. Smart investors are already accumulating these altcoins in anticipation of the SEC approving the ETFs. Some of the top altcoins that are surging are Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Metis (METIS) and Rollblock (RBLK). While these tokens are up by over 20%, crypto experts tip them to return over 100% in June. Thus, putting them in the list of altcoins to watch out for in the coming weeks.\n",
        "Rollblock: The Best Altcoin to Watch in 2024\n",
        "Rollblock (RBLK) is among the top altcoins that have gained traction recently. Although it is still in stage 2 of their presale, early investors have already raked up a 20% ROI. The success of the presale has seen Rollblock raise over $360,000 and experts anticipate it will reach $3M in June. Although ENS and Metis are also altcoins worth buying today, the new Rollblock GambleFi protocol has better prospects.\n",
        "Meanwhile, the Rollblock ecosystem is the world‚Äôs first backed crypto casino that allows token holders to receive a percentage of the platform‚Äôs revenue by holding the token. The revenue-sharing model allows the platform to use up to 30% of the weekly revenue to purchase the tokens from the open market. Next, 50% of the tokens bought are used for staking rewards, with the rest burned to stabilize the price.\n",
        "Notably, the Rollblock casino is fully operational and licensed with the platform‚Äôs security guaranteed. To ensure transparency, Rollblock ensures all transactions are permanent and immutable. Also, there is no need for KYC. All a user needs is an email to register. The native token RBLK is the currency of the platform and is used as a vehicle for distributing rewards, cashbacks etc.\n",
        "In the future, Rollblock will integrate automated solutions such as AI betting tools, which players can use to make better predictions. The RBLK token is sold for just $0.012. Analysts project an 880% rally before the end of the presale and 100x when it is listed in CEX exchanges, making it one of the altcoins to watch out for this year.\n",
        "Can the Ethereum Name Service Price hit $40 by June?\n",
        "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is an Ethereum-based crypto that aims to map human-readable names to machine-readable names. In the past few months, the Ethereum Name Service has partnered with top companies, which has increased the altcoin‚Äôs popularity. As per CoinMarketCap stats, the ENS price has increased by 115% in the past 12 months and 42% in the past month.\n",
        "Having opened the year at $9.66, the Ethereum Name Service price rose to $26 in March. However, the preceding market correction led to a drop. Meanwhile, with the ENS key market indicators showing bullish signals, the token is on course to retest the $26 mark. As such, a potential 5x rally is possible in June, making it one of the altcoins to buy now.\n",
        "Metis Price To Rise Following EasyBit Announcement\n",
        "In the past week, Metis has gained a massive 29% with the price moving from $57 to over $80. At the same time, the Metis market cap has increased to over $400M. However, investors seem to be losing confidence as the Metis trading volume is dropping.\n",
        "However, in the midst of these challenges, Metis is growing. EasyBit exchange has announced the token listing, with Singapore-based Alchemy Pay announcing its partnership with Metis for seamless fiat-crypto on- and off-ramp integration. With Metis price increasing by over 200% in the past year and with the increasing adoption, the token is set for massive rise soon. Having surpassed the 50-day and 200-day SMA, analysts tip the price to hit $200 in June.\n",
        "Which of the Top 3 Altcoins Should You Prioritize?\n",
        "The above three cryptos are good altcoins to buy for long-term profits. The major concern is your budget. For investors with a low budget, Rollblock might be the best option. While in presale, Rollblock is about to open the $450B gambling industry and make it accessible for all. Its interest in AI could drive more investors to the project, offering more potential for larger gains. Remember to DYOR before investing.\n",

        "The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act‚Äôs (FIT21) approval on Wednesday would align the US with other nations in terms of its regulatory framework for crypto, according to Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the Chamber of Progress.\n",
        "Bligen told Cryptonews in an interview Thursday that if the FIT21 bill passes the Senate and becomes law, it would stop crypto companies from leaving the US for countries with clearer regulations.\n",
        "The legislation would provide increased freedoms to cryptocurrency operators in the US. Additionally, it would shift more regulatory responsibility for digital assets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n",
        "It would also make it clear which businesses the SEC and CFTC regulate and would create a system for registering these businesses. This would allow them to legally serve customers who want to buy and sell digital assets. The SEC would oversee digital assets that are considered securities, while the CFTC would oversee things like commodities and derivatives related to digital assets.\n",
        "Outdated Law Hinders US Crypto Regulation\n",
        "Bligen pointed out the fact that the US has been using a nearly century-old law, the Howey Test, from the SEC to regulate cryptocurrency that was invented just a few years ago. He argued that the current system is outdated and doesn‚Äôt work for this technology.\n",
        "‚ÄúHopefully this [bill] establishes the US as a regulatory leader that wants strong consumer protections,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe already have the most liquid, most attractive capital markets in the US. There‚Äôs no reason why we can‚Äôt have the best cryptocurrency markets as well.‚Äù\n",
        "FIT21 Seen as Crypto Talent Retainer\n",
        "Harry Sudock, chief strategy officer at Bitcoin miner GRIID, agrees that the bill would propel the US to a competitive position in the international crypto scene. Additionally, he believes FIT21 would incentivize the brightest minds in crypto to come to and stay in the US.\n",
        "‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen a number of businesses either leave the US or decline to do business here thanks to regulatory uncertainty,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFIT21 will help those businesses return to the US, but the bill is really only just the start.‚Äù\n",
        "FIT21‚Äôs House Hurdle Cleared, Senate Showdown Looms\n",
        "FIT21‚Äôs journey to becoming law isn‚Äôt over yet. While it successfully cleared the House, it still faces an uphill battle. The bill needs to be approved by the Senate and then signed by the President before it becomes law. Whether the Senate will give it the green light remains to be seen.\n",
        "Ronen Cojocaru, CEO of automated crypto trading platform 8081, highlighted the unique challenges crypto bills face in the Senate. Some senators are familiar with the technology and may be vocal supporters or opponents of the FIT21 Act. However, others might lack a deep understanding of the intricacies of cryptocurrency, making them undecided on the bill‚Äôs merits.\n",
        "‚ÄúPublic opinion and upcoming elections influence Senators‚Äô decisions, aligning them with their party‚Äôs agenda and voter interests,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSenators can use a filibuster, requiring 60 votes to advance the bill, which is tough without strong bipartisan support.‚Äù\n",
        "Cojocaru also explained why the US is currently lagging behind other countries. He pointed to Switzerland, nicknamed ‚ÄúCrypto Valley,‚Äù as a prime example. Switzerland‚Äôs financial regulator, FINMA, fosters innovation by providing clear guidelines for crypto businesses, making it a global hub for the industry.\n",
        "Singapore has also attracted many crypto companies with its well-defined regulations and supportive policies. Its central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has struck a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding consumers. Similarly, Malta, known as the ‚ÄúBlockchain Island,‚Äù has become a magnet for crypto businesses with its comprehensive and crypto-friendly regulations.\n",
        "CFTC vs. SEC in Regulating Crypto\n",
        "Meanwhile, James Koutoulas founder at Typhon Capital Management, said FIT21 needs some work, especially for DeFi. Additionally, he highlighted the unprecedented power it gives the CFTC to regulate crypto as a spot commodity, which falls outside its usual domain of regulating commodity derivatives.\n",
        "‚ÄúBut, at least at the present time, the CFTC is infinitely less hostile to crypto than the SEC and seems focused on implementing regulatory pathways instead of maliciously attacking market leaders without the statutory authority to do so like the SEC,‚Äù Koutoulas said.\n"

        "This is a key point.

        "The US House on Thursday approved a bill that prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar, or central bank digital currency (CBDC), without explicit authorization from Congress.\n",
        "This legislation, known as the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act (HR 5403), passed with a vote of 216 to 192. Republicans voiced worries that a US CBDC could be used for government control over citizens‚Äô finances.\n",
        "The Fed itself hasn‚Äôt yet come out with a solid proposal to launch a digital dollar. But, the House vote reflects ongoing concerns among Republicans ‚Äì including former President Trump ‚Äì about potential government overreach with such a system.\n",
        "House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who introduced the legislation, argued a digital dollar could be a ‚Äúsurveillance tool‚Äù for the government, giving it the power to track transactions and potentially restrict activity they deem politically undesirable.\n",
        "His stance echoes Trump‚Äôs strong opposition to a CBDC, as the current Presidential candidate has vowed to block its creation if re-elected.\n",

        "Wednesday‚Äôs vote marks a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It is the first time a bill solely focused on crypto market regulation passed the House. But even though the crypto industry celebrates the FIT21 vote, challenges remain.\n",
        "Alan Mittleman, COO of Secure Digital Markets, told Cryptonews that the bill needs a companion version for the Senate. This new version will need committee revisions and face potential opposition from vocal crypto critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren. In short, the bill‚Äôs journey to becoming law is far from over.\n",
        "According to Mittleman, President Joe Biden seems worried that there aren‚Äôt enough consumer protections in FIT21. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt threatened a veto yet. But that suggests more work may be required on the bill to go through,‚Äù he added.\n"

        "Bitcoin‚Äôs current market position has sparked renewed interest in Bitcoin price prediction. Trading at $67,836.31 with a 24-hour trading volume of $42.4 billion, Bitcoin has dipped 2.27% in the last 24 hours.\n",
        "As the leading cryptocurrency with a market cap of $1.3 trillion, its movements are closely watched, with traders focusing on key resistance and support levels to gauge future price trends.\n",
        "Bitcoin Price Prediction\n",
        "Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading at $67,835, down 2.25% over the past 24 hours, signalling a bearish Bitcoin price prediction. The green line at $68,263 serves as the pivot point, which is crucial for determining the trend direction.\n",
        "Immediate resistance levels are at $70,029, $71,458, and $73,299. These levels could act as significant barriers to upward movement. On the downside, support levels are identified at $66,357, $64,947, and $63,490, offering potential buying opportunities if the price continues to decline.\n",
        "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.35, indicating that Bitcoin is approaching oversold conditions, which could suggest a potential reversal or stabilization around this level. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $68,615, acting as a resistance level close to the pivot point.\n",
        "Technically, Bitcoin shows signs of potential bearish movement as it trades below the pivot point. An entry strategy would be to sell below $68,263, targeting a take-profit level of $66,357 and setting a stop loss at $70,029.\n",
        "This approach leverages the potential for further decline while managing risk.\n",
        "Conclusion: Bitcoin‚Äôs current price action suggests a bearish outlook as it trades below the pivot point of $68,263. Immediate resistance levels are at $70,030, $71,450, and $73,300, while support levels are at $66,357, $64,947, and $63,490.\n",

        "Police think the international gang ran an ‚Äúopen chat room,‚Äù likely a crypto Telegram group or a KakaoTalk open chat, which pretended to offer bona fide crypto trading tips.\n",
        "Instead, officers said, the gang ‚Äúdefrauded 308 investors‚Äù out of some $18.8 million.\n",
        "Reading Room ‚Äì ‚ÄòCrypto Fraud Gang Preyed on Victims‚Äô\n",
        "Police spokespeople said some gang members posed as crypto experts in chat groups. Others pretended to be ordinary investors.\n",
        "These members allegedly claimed to have made money by following tips they learned in the ‚Äúreading room.‚Äù\n",
        "Per Global Kyungjae Shinmun, the Daegu Police Agency‚Äôs criminal task force announced it had made the arrests on May 21.\n",
        "However, the task force thinks at least six suspects are still at large. Police said these individuals are ‚Äústill overseas.‚Äù\n",
        "The task force said it had asked Interpol to issue red notices for all six. This would require overseas police officers to arrest the suspects on sight.\n",

        "Officers explained that the gang tried to convince room members to download apps connected to crypto exchanges, where they could buy and sell unlisted coins.\n",
        "The group then tried to build trust by ensuring potential victims made moderate gains when they invested minimal amounts of money in these allegedly bogus platforms.\n",
        "In many cases, this convinced victims to increase the value of their stakes. However, when victims tried to make withdrawals from the platforms, gang members told them to pay ‚Äúwithdrawal fees.‚Äù\n",

        "The incident occurred at the Federal High Court in Abuja shortly after the case was called for continuation before Justice Emeka Nwite.\n",
        "Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen, and British-Kenyan national Nadeem Anjarwalla face charges of laundering over $35 million and engaging in specialized financial activities without a license. Both executives have pleaded not guilty.\n",
        "Detained Binance Executive Slumped During Trial\n",
        "The courtroom drama unfolded when Gambaryan, Binance‚Äôs head of financial crimes compliance, did not immediately step forward to the dock when the case was called. Seated in the back row, he was assisted by his lawyer towards the dock but collapsed en route and had to be sat in the front row.\n",

        "\n",
        "Since February, Gambaryan‚Äôs health issues have reportedly worsened. A letter presented to Judge Emeka Nwite highlighted that Gambaryan had broken down and received intravenous treatment for malaria the previous day. Consequently, he was also absent from a tax evasion trial held the day before.\n",
        "Judge Nwite ruled that Gambaryan should receive treatment at the hospital recommended by his lawyer or another designated by prison authorities. The trial has been adjourned to June 20 and 21 to allow Gambaryan‚Äôs medical treatment.\n",
        "The case has attracted considerable attention, especially given Nigeria‚Äôs ongoing economic challenges. The country has accused Binance of contributing to its currency woes, as Binance and other cryptocurrency platforms have become famous for trading the Nigerian naira amid severe dollar shortages and a plummeting currency.\n",
        "Throughout the proceedings, Gambaryan was visibly weak, leaning on the armrest of his seat.\n",
        "Tax Evasion Charges Against Binance\n",
        "The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has filed tax evasion charges against Binance Holdings Limited and Gambaryan. Due to his absence, however, the trial could not proceed on Wednesday and has now been moved to June 14.\n",
        "Gambaryan, reportedly held at Kuje Prison, did not appear for his scheduled arraignment, confusing the lawyers. Justice Emeka Nwite, overseeing the case, had previously denied Gambaryan‚Äôs bail application due to new money laundering charges filed by the EFCC and deemed him a flight risk. The prosecution and defense argued over the failure to ensure Gambaryan‚Äôs presence, leading to the adjournment.\n",
        "Gambaryan‚Äôs absence from the arraignment session highlighted procedural issues, as his lawyer argued that the prosecution should have ensured his presence given his federal custody status.\n",
        "Anjarwalla, who escaped custody in March, is still involved in the case but has not been officially marked as ‚Äúat large,‚Äù which could complicate proceedings since Nigerian law requires all parties to be served for the case to move forward.\n"

        "The AMF emphasized that ByBit does not hold a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) license in France, and investors were urged to protect their assets invested on the platform. Similarly, the AMF previously warned against the Bitget crypto exchange for similar reasons, noting its blacklisting in November 2023. ByBit faced additional scrutiny when the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in Hong Kong labeled it a ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù cryptocurrency exchange in March, listing some of its products as suspicious investment products.\n",
