        "Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies and enjoys the biggest market share in the domain of crypto. However, many people are still doubtful about purchasing Bitcoin. As a matter of fact, most of them believe that buying Bitcoin from crypto exchanges can be an intimidating process. In such cases, it is important to look for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund or ETF as an alternative solution.",
        "It is important to note that technical aspects of Bitcoin ownership, such as private keys, Bitcoin addresses, and crypto wallets, can create confusion for newcomers. The demand for a Bitcoin ETF gained momentum due to the need for a more transparent and easier method to invest in Bitcoin. With the arrival of ETFs, investors would find a direct channel for investing in Bitcoin. You must also note that ETFs offer an easy way to invest in bonds, currencies, and equities.",
        "The concept of ETFs has dominated traditional financial markets for years. It is important to note that ETFs make up a $7 trillion industry that allows investors to capitalize on performance of a basket of assets. The growing demand for BTC ETFs can be verified by the fact that major financial institutions in the US have applied to launch ETFs.",
        "Some of the top names, such as Fidelity and BlackRock, have sent applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC to launch ETFs. Interestingly, other countries in Europe, Canada, and Brazil have been quicker to come up with approvals for Bitcoin ETFs. Let us learn more about Bitcoin ETFs and how they work.",
        "Enroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.",
        "Definition of a Bitcoin ETF",
        "The definition of a Bitcoin ETF paints it as a publicly traded investment fund that can offer exposure to Bitcoin. The special highlight of ETFs is that you don’t have to own the cryptocurrency. If you are interested in Bitcoin ETFs trading, then you must know that ETFs cannot be traded on crypto exchanges like other cryptocurrencies.",
        "On the contrary, ETFs are traded through traditional securities exchanges, such as NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange. In technical terms, the Bitcoin ETF tracks the performance of Bitcoin with the help of futures contracts. Future contracts are derivative investment securities that help investors speculate on the future prices of assets.",
        "A brief overview of the workings of Bitcoin ETFs showcases that Bitcoin futures contracts serve as agreements between two parties. Such contracts specify the conditions for buying or selling a particular amount of Bitcoin at a predefined price at a specific time in future. With the help of futures market, investors could find an effective solution for hedging against possible price fluctuations of Bitcoin.",
        "The most important highlight of a Bitcoin ETF guide is that you don’t have to purchase Bitcoin directly. In simple words, exchange-traded funds help in buying shares in a fund that holds ownership of Bitcoin. On top of it, regulations for ETFs also ensure that traditional investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without technological hurdles.",
        "Get familiar with the terms related to cryptocurrency with Cryptocurrency Flashcards.",
        "What are the notable Variables of Bitcoin ETFs?",
        "If you want to know how Bitcoin ETF works, then you must know about the notable variants of Bitcoin ETFs. The most popular variant of Bitcoin ETFs is futures Bitcoin ETFs, while spot Bitcoin ETFs await approval from the US SEC. The futures Bitcoin ETFs do not actually hold Bitcoin and rely on Bitcoin futures contracts for offering exposure to Bitcoin. Bitcoin futures contracts help investors speculate on the future price of Bitcoin and bet on it.",
        "The behavior of futures Bitcoin ETFs is different from that of spot Bitcoin ETFs. For example, you might come across additional costs for rolling over or settlement of futures contracts. As a matter of fact, some futures Bitcoin ETFs are tailored to offer inverse exposure to Bitcoin price, thereby helping investors leverage profits as well as losses.",
        "On the other hand, spot BTC ETF is an exchange-traded fund that offers direct exposure to the current pricing of Bitcoin. The term ‘spot’ implies the current or immediate price of the underlying asset or Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs generally have ownership of actual Bitcoin and work by closely tracking the real-time pricing of Bitcoin. In other words, spot Bitcoin ETFs invest directly in Bitcoin. The value of ETF is directly correlated to the price of Bitcoin in the market.",

        "What is the Necessity of ETFs?",
        "You might wonder why you should invest in Bitcoin ETFs when you can buy Bitcoin directly from crypto exchanges. It is important to look at Bitcoin exchange-traded funds from the perspective of regular retail investors. They still perceive that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a risky investment choice.",
        "First of all, it is important to note that cryptocurrencies do not have clear regulations. You would need a Bitcoin wallet and trustworthy crypto exchanges to purchase Bitcoin. Any individual who is new to cryptocurrencies would have doubts regarding interactions with crypto exchanges.",
        "Ownership of Bitcoin also means that you have to take responsibility for security of the assets. You have to ensure safety of your private keys with the help of a hardware wallet or store your private keys in a secure location. On top of it, you might have to figure out the ideal methods for filing taxes on the sales of Bitcoin, which leads to capital gains.",
        "With the help of Bitcoin ETF trading, investors would not have to worry about storage, security, and their private keys. Users could only own shares in a Bitcoin ETF, like the shares of a company’s stock in traditional markets. It can help you gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassles of purchasing and storing cryptocurrencies.",
        "Therefore, ETFs are an extremely appealing value proposition for regular retail investors as well as institutional investors. Different types of investment firms and hedge funds have filed applications to the US SEC to obtain approvals for Bitcoin ETFs.",

        "Working Mechanism of Bitcoin ETFs",
        "The next important highlight in a Bitcoin ETF guide points to its working mechanism. You must note that Bitcoin ETFs work in a similar manner as traditional ETFs. The big difference with Bitcoin ETFs is that they are linked to the performance of Bitcoin futures contracts rather than traditional assets such as bonds and stocks. Bitcoin ETFs invest in the related Bitcoin futures contracts alongside other financial instruments that replicate the performance of Bitcoin.",
        "Bitcoin ETFs are available on stock exchanges like individual stocks, and the pricing of the ETFs depends on the underlying Bitcoin futures contracts. Investors aspiring to gain exposure to Bitcoin market can purchase shares in a Bitcoin futures ETF just like any traditional ETF.",
        "The explanations for how Bitcoin ETF works show that they are similar to traditional exchange-traded funds. Generally, an asset management company or ETF issuer buys the underlying asset and stores it securely with selected custodians. Subsequently, the issuer would issue shares of the fund to provide access to underlying assets in the fund.",
        "The financial institution takes an annual fund management fee and bears the responsibility of buying, storage, and safekeeping for Bitcoin on behalf of investors in Bitcoin ETF. Upon making investments in Bitcoin ETF, you would purchase shares in a pool of Bitcoin. The working of Bitcoin ETF also focuses on creating new ETF shares to match the demand. When users sell their shares, they are redeemed, thereby adjusting the supply of ETF shares.",

        "History of Progress of Bitcoin ETF",
        "The introduction to BTC ETF also requires an in-depth review of the history of Bitcoin ETFs. When did the journey of Bitcoin ETFs begin? Interestingly, the famous Winklevoss Twins were the first players to advocate for ETFs by filing the first Bitcoin ETF proposal in July 2013. However, the SEC rejected the proposal and also thwarted their second Bitcoin ETF proposal in June 2018. The SEC continued rejecting Bitcoin ETF proposals till February 2020. In September 2020, the Bermuda Stock Exchange listed the first Bitcoin ETF.",
        "Canada became the first country to launch its Bitcoin ETF in February 2021 and also approved two more ETFs in the same month. The first Bitcoin ETF listed in the US was launched in October 2021. Another notable milestone for Bitcoin exchange-traded fund history is the order by a US court to review the decision of SEC to deny application of Grayscale for a spot Bitcoin ETF.",
        "Subsequently, the SEC did not appeal, and thus, the US Court of Appeals issued a formal order in October 2023 for the SEC to review the application of Grayscale. In December 2023, the chairman of SEC claimed that the regulatory authority has been reviewing applications for launching a sport Bitcoin ETF.",

        "Digital technologies such as Deep Learning and Machine Learning have taken the world by storm. Although these technologies are in their nascent stage, they have shown immense potential. The emergence of these technological concepts is a boon for individuals and businesses alike. Today, it has become a necessity to gain insight into the technologies that are revolutionizing our lives.\n",
        "However, if you want to understand these technologies at a comprehensive level, you need to familiarize yourself with not only the unique concepts but also the differences that exist between them. For someone who wants to have a promising career in the competitive IT industry, it is essential to know how concepts such as DL and ML are influencing the trajectory of AI. Before understanding the deep learning vs machine learning difference, it is essential to have a clear knowledge of the respective technological concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is Machine Learning?\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML) is a subdomain of Artificial Intelligence technology. ML primarily focuses on the creation of algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to learn. Thanks to ML, computers can make decisions or predictions without the need to explicitly program them.\n",
        "Thus, Machine Learning involves training algorithms to support the identification of relationships and patterns. Ultimately, such patterns help make predictions about new data. In simple words, ML is the type of Artificial Intelligence that relies on minimum human interference.\n",
        "Some of the chief features of Machine Learning are:\n",
        "Take your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n",
        "What is Deep Learning?\n",
        "Deep Learning is a part of Machine Learning. It makes use of neural networks with diverse layers to analyze complex associations and patterns in data. It is capable of mimicking the human brain to carry out a broad range of tasks, such as speech recognition as well as natural language processing. One of the main highlights of Deep Learning models is that they are capable of learning. Hence, they can improve over time, and their level of accuracy can improve as they process data.\n",
        "Some of the chief features of Deep Learning are:\n",
        "Although to a layman, the terms Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning may sound similar. The reality is that each of these concepts is different from one another. However, they are related to each other. Now that you have clarity on deep learning and machine learning concepts, it is time to answer the following question: What are the differences between deep learning and machine learning?\n",
        "Excited to learn the fundamentals of AI applications in business? Enroll now in the AI For Business Course\n",
        "Difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning\n",
        "There exist a number of deep learning vs machine learning differences. By identifying how the technological concepts are unique, it is possible to identify their true potential.\n",
        "Machine Learning is the branch of Artificial Intelligence. Since it is trained on statistical models and algorithms, it is capable of making predictions. The technology relies on historical data as well as training to strengthen its capabilities. A key thing to bear in mind is that ML relies on human intervention so that data can be fed and improvements can be made.\n",
        "Deep Learning can be defined as the subset of Machine Learning technology. It is a model that can help an algorithm ascertain whether a prediction is accurate or not. The role of neural networks is indispensable in Deep Learning. As neural networks empower software to comprehend complex patterns, there is no need for human intervention.\n",
        "The difference between machine learning and deep learning arises from the use of data representation. In the case of machine learning, the data representation that is used is quite different from that of deep learning. In Machine Learning, structured data is used. This type of data is highly valuable since it can be searched and analyzed in a simple and efficient manner. ML techniques may find it challenging to work on unstructured data. This is due to the fact that the training dataset may have infinite variations.\n",
        "The data representation that is used in Deep Learning is different as it involves neural networks. DL is capable of working with not only structured data but also with unstructured data. The technology can be used for a broad range of unstructured data such as images, audio, text as well as tables containing data.\n",
        "The values that are arranged in structures are known as data points. Machine Learning encompasses thousands of data points, whereas Deep Learning involves millions of data points. This feature goes on to show that Machine Learning is capable of working well with relatively small databases. On the other hand, Deep Learning relies on a humongous volume of data while carrying out its task. DL basically requires large amounts of data so that it can understand and perform tasks better than conventional ML algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "While exploring deep learning vs machine learning, a key difference that arises is related to the training time. Training time is basically the time that is taken by a model for the purpose of training on a dataset. When it comes to ML algorithms, they require less time for training. The training time may range between a few seconds to a number of hours. However, the same is not the case when it comes to Deep Learning. The training time for a Deep Learning neural network may span between a few hours to several weeks. However, it may be possible to adopt certain methods to hasten the training time.\n",
        "When it comes to Machine Learning, it may be possible to set up and run the system in no time. However, although it may be easy to set up the system, it does not mean that its effectiveness is guaranteed. In fact, the effectiveness of the system may be hampered. On the contrary, setting up Deep Learning may seem time-consuming, but there is no compromise on the effectiveness of the system. Once the system is up and running, there is a need for limited or no intervention. It is capable of generating results in an effective manner. Moreover, the quality of the outcome is likely to get better with the passage of time.\n",
        "The resources that are required for ML systems and DL systems may vary considerably. It is possible to execute Machine Learning on simple and standard computer systems. As ML does not require a large volume of computational power, it can be supported by a standard computer. However, the same cannot be said about deep Learning.\n",
        "Deep Learning systems require powerful hardware and software resources so that they can function properly. As DL involves a broad number of operations, it needs a robust system that can support it. In the absence of appropriate resources, the efficiency and functionality of DL may be diminished.\n",

        "When it comes to deep learning vs machine learning, a key difference is related to the featurization process. In machine learning, it is essential for users to identify and create features accurately. It shows that the technology relies on users to carry out its tasks and functions. However, in the case of deep learning technology, there is no need for users to intervene. DL is capable of learning high-level features from the data itself. That’s not all! Deep Learning can create new features all by itself without relying on the help and support of humans.\n",
        "The table below presents a comparison between Deep Learning and Machine Learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future of ML and DL\n",
        "In the technology-driven era, the future of Machine Learning and Deep Learning is full of promise and potential. The unique features and capabilities of these technologies make them highly capable of carrying out a broad range of tasks and operations. As AI technology is reaching new heights, the future of both ML and DL is extremely bright.\n",
        "If you wish to make your career in the dynamic IT domain, it is a must to broaden your knowledge about AI, ML, and DL.

On top of it, the existing crypto market features a vibrant combination of new cryptocurrencies and regulatory developments.\n",
        "Institutional Adoption of Cryptocurrencies\n",
        "Big corporations such as Microsoft, AMC, Tesla, AT\u0026T, and PayPal have adopted cryptocurrencies for their financial transactions. The trend has not been slowing down, and many new businesses will also join this trend in future. For example, corporate giant MicroStrategy has been continuously investing in Bitcoin, thereby leading to a rise in institutional investments.\n",
        "Rise of Decentralized Finance\n",
        "Another prominent addition among current trends that would influence the future of cryptocurrency is the rise of DeFi. Decentralized finance has become an important trend in the crypto landscape due to its unique value-based benefits. Most importantly, DeFi aims to transform the conventional financial landscape by offering financial services without intermediaries such as banks or brokerage firms.\n",
        "The growth of DeFi is clearly evident in the rising number of DeFi applications for different financial services, including insurance and lending. On top of it, you must also note how the DeFi sector has grown at an exponential rate in recent times. Some of the most popular DeFi protocols, such as MakerDAO, Uniswap, Aave, Curve Finance, and Lido, have strengthened the foundations of the DeFi market.\n",

        "Regulatory Intervention\n",
        "The list of current trends in the domain of cryptocurrencies also includes regulatory attention. As a matter of fact, regulatory intervention has a major impact on long-term cryptocurrency predictions as governments are focusing more on cryptocurrencies than ever.\n",
        "Even if regulations bring certain risks to the world of cryptocurrencies, they also promise certain advantages, such as investor protection and improved stability. Most importantly, crypto regulations can open new opportunities, such as investment in crypto ETFs.\n",
        "The US Securities and Exchange Commission has recently introduced approval for crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin ETFs. You can notice how enhanced regulations can improve the legitimacy of the crypto market and attract more investors. On the other hand, excessive pressure from regulations can restrict innovation while reducing the element of decentralization that differentiates crypto from other financial instruments.\n",
        "Bitcoin Halving\n",
        "The list of prominent trends in the crypto market right now also draws attention towards Bitcoin halving. It represents a recurring event on Bitcoin blockchain that involves reducing the Bitcoin mining rewards by half. The last halving event of Bitcoin reduced the block reward to 6.25 BTC from 12.5 BTC in May 2020.\n",
        "Most of the short-term cryptocurrency future predictions include Bitcoin halving expected in 2024. Interestingly, the Bitcoin halving process has always led to promising price improvements due to reduction of Bitcoin supply. Therefore, the crypto market would face the impact of anticipation that can determine crypto prices in future.\n",
        "Enroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.\n",
        "How will the Crypto Market Look Five Years from Now?\n",
        "The discussions about cryptocurrency future scope also require emphasis on the trends in the crypto market for the next five years. As the cryptocurrency revolution gains momentum, the expectations regarding the state of the crypto market have been becoming more popular. Here are some of the most prominent trends that could shape the crypto market in next five years.\n",
        "One of the foremost additions among the predictions for the crypto market points to their role in ensuring the shift from traditional finance. The most noticeable entry into the future of crypto in the next 5 years would be the rising institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n",
        "Conventional financial institutions are more likely to dive deeper into the world of crypto for diversification of their investment portfolios. With the growing attention towards regulatory approval of Bitcoin ETFs, it is imperative that the future might bring different types of alternative crypto investments by traditional financial firms.\n",
        "Most of the discussions about the cryptocurrency market focus on questions like “Which crypto will boom in next 5 years?” and the ways to achieve profits with cryptocurrencies. However, it is also important to reflect on how the financial value of cryptocurrencies can encourage their use in philanthropy. Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity as a suitable tool for donations. As a matter of fact, certain predictions suggest that the cryptocurrency sector might help in garnering more than $10 billion in donations over the next ten years.\n",
        "Excited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n",
        "The two most popular terms that have been making waves in the crypto landscape recently include DeFi and NFTs. Decentralized Finance leverages blockchain and cryptocurrencies to offer a new definition of accessibility of financial services. The growing popularity of DeFi protocols would define the future of cryptocurrency landscape as more conventional institutions are likely to adopt DeFi solutions in large numbers.\n",
        "On top of it, NFTs have also become another mainstream digital asset that has been shaping the dynamics of the crypto market. Furthermore, the arrival of new token standards has created a major revolution in the domain of NFT trading. The growth of NFT will be consistent in the future on the basis of such innovative developments.\n",
        "The adoption of more cryptocurrencies in the market would call for increased focus on security. As of now, the security of cryptocurrencies revolves primarily around the selection of the right wallets. You should also notice how two-factor authentication and public-private key cryptography are the existing solutions for cryptocurrency security. However, long-term cryptocurrency predictions suggest that cryptocurrency security will evolve further in the future. Interestingly, companies such as Fireblocks have already been working on advanced security solutions for crypto assets.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to increase, it is reasonable to expect that more people will want to learn about cryptocurrencies. Most of the cryptocurrency future predictions suggest that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology might be the focal themes of professional training courses.\n",
        "As a matter of fact, educational institutions might also offer training courses on cryptocurrencies and related concepts. For example, 101 Blockchains have already introduced blockchain and cryptocurrency courses in their curriculum.\n",
        "Another significant trend in the cryptocurrency market that you can expect in the next five years is interoperability. The predictions about future of crypto in the next 5 years emphasize the possibilities for growth of interconnectivity. New interoperability solutions can ensure smooth and seamless operations across different networks and cryptocurrencies. One the examples of such solutions is Wrapped Bitcoin. On top of that, you can also notice how crypto or blockchain bridges have been addressing concerns about interoperability.\n",
        "The most crucial trend that would mark the future of crypto would be AI. Artificial intelligence has a major role in refining the cryptocurrency future scope by focusing on security, blockchain management, and trading. Artificial intelligence can help in faster and more accurate analysis of vast amounts of data, thereby leading to efficient risk assessment, predictive models, and efficient trading strategies.\n",
        "AI can also help improve security in the cryptocurrency landscape through detection of suspicious activities or fraudulent patterns. Furthermore, AI can also help in effective management of nodes and the verification process with better scalability and efficiency.\n",
        "Unlock your potential in Artificial Intelligence with the Certified AI Professional (CAIP)™ Certification. Elevate your career with expert-led training and gain the skills needed to thrive in today’s AI-driven world.\n",
        "Final Words\n",
        "The predictions for future of cryptocurrency suggest that cryptocurrencies will become a major aspect of the financial landscape. Cryptocurrencies can encourage the transition from traditional finance towards efficient and more effective financial instruments.\n",
        "On top of it, regulatory approval for cryptocurrencies would also open up new avenues for improving institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. You must stay updated with the latest developments in the crypto industry to predict the future of crypto. Dive deeper into the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies and discover how the crypto space will look in the next five years.\n",

        "Bitcoin is probably the most valuable cryptocurrency that you would find in the crypto market now. It is not only the first cryptocurrency but also the face of the cryptocurrency industry. However, the biggest problem with Bitcoin is that no one is there to back the most valuable crypto asset. If you lose your Bitcoin, there is no court, financial institution, or government that would listen to your complaint.\n",
        "Therefore, the interest in best practices to restore Bitcoin wallet has been a prominent highlight for investors who want to enter the cryptocurrency market. Anyone who loses their Bitcoin wallet would obviously wonder about the methods to recover it and its valuable assets. Let us find proven and tested methods that can help you recover your Bitcoin wallets.\n",
        "Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n",
        "How Can You Lose Bitcoin Wallets?\n",
        "Bitcoin wallets are the most risky tools in the blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape. They have promising potential, and as the value of Bitcoin increases, Bitcoin wallets can become easy targets for hackers. You would need a Bitcoin wallet backup to restore functionalities in case of accidental loss of wallets. A better understanding of the reasons for which Bitcoin wallets might be lost can help you prevent such losses. In addition, it can also help you find the best ways to restore your lost assets. Here are the common reasons for which you can lose Bitcoin wallets.\n",
        "Loss of Private Keys\n",
        "One of the most important aspects of accessing your Bitcoin wallet is the private key. Private keys are strings of characters that are unique to each wallet and can help access and manage Bitcoin. Most of the people who ask questions like “How do I recover my lost Bitcoin wallet?” are troubled by the problem of losing their private keys. Losing your private key is similar to losing the keys to your safe. An individual can lose their private keys due to data corruption, forgetfulness, or hardware failure. Therefore, it is important to follow safe storage practices to safeguard your private keys.\n",
        "Death of Bitcoin Wallet Owner\n",
        "The death of a Bitcoin wallet owner also presents a formidable challenge to the world of digital assets. If the Bitcoin wallet owner has not implemented any measures for estate planning to transfer private key information, then their Bitcoin wallet might become completely inaccessible. It creates difficulty for Bitcoin wallet recovery, as highlighted in various examples. Therefore, it is important to include cryptocurrencies in estate planning or choose Dead Man’s switches for crypto.\n",
        "Sending Bitcoin to Wrong Addresses\n",
        "Anyone can send Bitcoins to the wrong address by mistake. Since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, there is no way to recover the assets from your wallet. Therefore, you should double-check the transaction details before sending Bitcoin.\n",
        "Bitcoin Burn Wallets\n",
        "Bitcoin wallets can be inaccessible when they are used as burn wallets. The primary purpose of burning wallets is to remove coins from circulation. You cannot think of methods to recover Bitcoin wallet passwords for burn wallets as they don’t offer scope for retrieval. Bitcoin is sent to burn wallets with the intention of making them permanently inaccessible.\n",
        "Dormant Bitcoin Wallets\n",
        "Bitcoin wallets can become dormant when they have not been utilized in any transaction for a long period. There are different reasons for which Bitcoin wallets can become dormant, such as owners losing interest in Bitcoin. Dormant wallets can indicate the removal of Bitcoin from active circulation, which enhances its scarcity.\n",
        "Bitcoin Theft\n",
        "Bitcoin wallets are not immune to theft. You might have to find ways to restore Bitcoin wallet when you fall victim to Bitcoin theft. Cybercriminals and hackers use different types of tactics to lay their hands on your Bitcoin wallets. For example, they can use social engineering attacks to trick users into entering their private keys.\n",
        "Frozen Bitcoin Wallets\n",
        "Centralized exchanges are the popular choices among Bitcoin wallets that offer custodial solutions without any burden of managing your Bitcoins. However, the problem with centralized exchanges is that they can freeze your wallets anytime. For example, centralized exchanges can freeze the accounts that are suspected of being involved in malicious activity. In such cases, legitimate users might also lose access to their Bitcoin wallets due to potential security breaches by hackers or mistakes in flagging errors.\n",
        "Enroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.\n",
        "How Can You Find Bitcoin on Your Device?\n",
        "The search for lost Bitcoin wallets can lead you to different answers, which are generally confusing. It is important to remember that Bitcoin wallets are not like your physical wallets, where you can store your bank cards and cash. You must learn about Bitcoin wallet backup restore features only with an in-depth understanding of public and private keys. However, human error can creep in somewhere, and you may end up giving away your private keys or forgetting that you even have a wallet.\n",
        "If you don’t remember where you have stored your Bitcoin wallet, you can look for your wallet data on your computer or storage devices. The wallet file is available as ‘wallet.dat,’ and it includes your transaction history, private keys, and public keys. You can begin your Bitcoin wallet recovery by learning about the methods to find the wallet file. Here is an outline of the steps you can follow to retrieve your wallet file on different operating systems.\n",
        "Press Win+F.\n",
        "Enter “wallet.dat” in the search window. Make sure that you don’t include the quotation marks.\n",
        "Now, visit the “Programs and Components” section to find programs with the term ‘Bitcoin’ in their name.\n",
        "You can use the Finder on macOS to look for the directory “~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallet.dat” in it.\n",
        "In addition, you should also look for text files that have the terms ‘Bitcoin,’ ‘key,’ ‘password,’ ‘BTC,’ and ‘wallet’ in their names.\n",

        "How Can You Recover Your Bitcoin Wallet?\n",
        "The recovery of a Bitcoin wallet might seem like an almost impossible task. If you don’t find the wallet file, you are more likely to be frustrated about losing your valuable assets. It is true that you can recover Bitcoin wallet password only after facing a lot of challenges. Here are some of the methods you can try to retrieve your lost Bitcoin wallet.\n",
        "The first step to recovering your Bitcoin wallet is to know the type of Bitcoin wallet you want to recover. You may have selected a web wallet for convenience or a hardware wallet for security. Some people also choose paper wallets for simplicity or mobile wallets to access their crypto assets from anywhere. The answers to “How do I recover my lost Bitcoin wallet?” might suggest that you should look for transaction history on Blockchain Explorer.\n",
        "It can help you find clues about the wallet address and the type of wallet you used for the transaction. On top of it, you can also use known addresses in Bitcoin transactions to identify the type of wallet. Every wallet type has unique methods for recovery, implying the necessity of finding the correct wallet.\n",
        "Paper wallets are simple tools to store your private keys, as you can just write them down on a piece of paper and store them somewhere safe. However, if you lose a paper wallet, there is a very slim chance of recovery. You cannot restore Bitcoin wallet in paper form. All you can do is look for a second copy of the paper wallet or the wallet file on your device.\n",
        "Crypto exchanges offer custodial wallets to hold and trade your cryptocurrencies. You must start by identifying the crypto exchange you used to store your Bitcoin. Custodial wallets on crypto exchanges allow users to access their wallets through traditional methods, such as email addresses and passwords.\n",
        "Therefore, the Bitcoin wallet recovery for such wallets involves checking your email inbox to find your login credentials. You can follow the password recovery process of the crypto exchange and restore access to your Bitcoin account. However, you cannot follow this process when the crypto exchange has blocked your account.\n",
        "Excited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n",
        "You can recover a software wallet by finding the device on which you used the wallet. It is possible that you may have saved your private keys on multiple files on your computer. You can also check anything that can store your private keys, such as USB drives. Another important answer to “How do I recover my lost Bitcoin wallet?” in the case of software wallets is the seed phrase. You have to find the seed phrase on physical belongings, as it is the best chance at restoring your software wallet.\n",
        "If you don’t have the private keys or the seed phrase, then you can choose recovery tools to find the ‘wallet.dat’ file. For example, Puran File Recovery is a popular tool for retrieving lost or deleted files and partitions. Recuva is also one of the popular choices for recovering deleted files from USB sticks, hard drives, and memory cards. Mac users can opt for TestDisk to recover lost partitions. However, these tools do not offer the assurance of recovering all your files and partitions.\n",
        "You can restore Bitcoin wallet in the case of hardware wallets with the help of your PIN code. However, you would have only three attempts to enter the PIN code. Wrong attempts can cause the device to restart, and you can bid goodbye to your wallet forever. Therefore, use the PIN code method only if you remember it.\n",
        "Without the PIN code, you can use the seed phrase of the wallet. Most of the hardware wallet devices offer a card to write down your seed phrase. You should try looking for that card or any copies that you might have made. Look for it everywhere before you are sure that you have lost it. The last resort to recover your Bitcoin hardware wallet involves physically hacking into the wallet. At the same time, it is also important to remember that top hardware wallet devices offer advanced security features, making them completely immune to physical hacking.\n",

        "Final Words\n",
        "The responses to queries about recovering Bitcoin wallets offer a ray of hope for people who think that they have lost their Bitcoin forever. Since Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no way you can turn to the law or governments to recover Bitcoin wallets. On top of that, the journey to recover Bitcoin wallet password is a difficult one. However, you can try out different methods to restore your Bitcoin wallet according to the type of wallet you use.\n",
        "For example, you can use your email inbox to find login credentials for your software wallet. In the case of hardware wallets, you can use the seed phrase to recover the wallet.

        "Cryptocurrency exchanges are the biggest tools used in the crypto industry at the moment. The first crypto exchange was created in 2010, and then many others made their entry into the market, improving the accessibility of cryptocurrencies. However, centralized exchanges have posed significant limitations that restrict the potential for large-scale usage. Therefore, the best decentralized exchanges have emerged as helpful alternatives for crypto traders.\n",
        "The examples of centralized crypto exchanges such as FTX set the wrong precedent for crypto users. On top of it, the frequent complaints about downtime on popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase also showcase the crypto industry in bad light. Let us find out how decentralized exchanges solve the problems found in centralized exchanges and a list of popular decentralized exchanges you should try in 2024.\n",
        "Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n",
        "How Does a Decentralized Exchange Work?\n",
        "You can compare the different entries in a list of decentralized exchanges with an enhanced understanding of their working mechanism. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces that remove the single points of failure evident in centralization. As a result, they help take away most of the risks associated with centralized exchanges.\n",
        "Aren’t they meant to be the perfect solutions to problems with centralized exchanges? Do DEXs address only the risk of single points of failure? The first generation of DEXs aimed at replicating the user experience of centralized exchanges and used order books. However, such types of decentralized exchanges presented difficulties in usability and were expensive and inefficient.\n",
        "The reputation of decentralized exchanges improved when Automated Market Makers or AMMs were introduced in DEX design. Most of the top decentralized exchanges use AMMs, which are smart contracts that can automatically set the price of crypto assets on the basis of supply and demand.\n",
        "The new decentralized exchanges could allow anyone to swap tokens in a trustless environment and lock their tokens in liquidity pools. AMM smart contracts are responsible for establishing the exchange rate and the rewards for liquidity providers. At the same time, AMMs also offer an intuitive user experience in decentralized exchanges.\n",
        "1Inch\n",
        "The first entry among the most notable DEXs is 1Inch, which offers the advantage of combining the best features of different DEXs. 1Inch helps you avoid confusion with queries like “Which is the best-decentralized exchange?” as it is a DEX aggregator.\n",
        "It works by finding the best prices by comparing liquidity across different decentralized exchanges. Crypto investors can rely on 1Inch for freedom from transaction or withdrawal fees. On top of it, 1Inch offers support for different crypto wallets, thereby ensuring better accessibility to the crypto space.\n",

        "dYdX\n",
        "Order-based DEXs did not match up to the challenge of achieving better solutions to issues of centralized exchanges. However, dYdX still enjoys popularity amidst AMM-based DEXs. It offers many features like shirt selling, leveraged trading, and lending.\n",
        "Therefore, it is a better alternative than simple AMMs. dYdX is a promising addition to the most popular decentralized exchanges, and it combines multiple features in one package. It offers a user-friendly interface, deep liquidity, and advantages of low fees.\n",
        "Uniswap\n",
        "Uniswap is the leading decentralized exchange in the market, with a wide user base. It offers liquidity for the most popular crypto tokens and leverages AMMs for self-regulation. The DAO governance makes Uniswap one of the best-decentralized exchanges with better efficiency and transparency.\n",
        "On top of that, Uniswap is the first decentralized exchange in the world to offer flexibility for trading ERC20 tokens. Uniswap also has its native token, UNI, which allows the owners to provide liquidity to the exchange and earn rewards. However, it has some limitations, such as offering support only for EVM-compatible crypto tokens.\n",
        "PancakeSwap\n",
        "PancakeSwap, as the name implies, has some similarities to Uniswap and other AMM-based decentralized exchanges. It is the most innovative solution on Binance Smart Chain, which contributes to lower gas fees for users. PancakeSwap is a worthy contender in this list of decentralized exchanges for its emphasis on user experience.\n",
        "Users can also stake the native tokens on PancakeSwap to earn rewards alongside capitalizing on the flexibility for yield farming. Most important of all, it offers faster transactions than Uniswap and a bevy of user-friendly features, making it a top DEX.\n",
        "\n",
        "Curve Finance\n",
        "The next top name among the biggest decentralized exchanges is Curve Finance. As a matter of fact, Curve Finance is the second biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum in terms of TVL. Initially, it offered the facility for stablecoin swaps only. However, it has evolved and offers many trading pairs now.\n",
        "On the other hand, the optimization of Curve Finance for stablecoin trading makes it the best pick for low-slippage rates. Another impressive feature of Curve Finance is the support for multiple blockchains alongside better efficiency for larger transactions.\n",
        "Balancer\n",
        "Balancer is another popular choice among decentralized exchanges for its unique features. It is a prominent answer to questions such as “Which is the best-decentralized exchange?” because of its capability to help users manage a diverse portfolio. The DEX offers the flexibility for creating and joining pools with a combination of eight different crypto tokens.\n",
        "Balancer is the ideal decentralized exchange for anyone who wants to manage a diverse portfolio of crypto assets. Balancer also caters to the needs of traders seeking advanced strategies to offer liquidity. The diverse asset exposure opens up the prospects for landing compounded returns.\n",
        "SushiSwap\n",
        "Another prominent derivative of Uniswap, which has garnered popularity for its distinctive set of features, is SushiSwap. The primary objective of creating SushiSwap was to offer a better alternative to Uniswap with better rewards.\n",
        "However, it has developed its own unique identity with diverse features for users and a special theme for branding its user experience. SushiSwap users can swap assets and offer liquidity alongside borrowing and lending assets. It also follows the lines of decentralized exchanges that offer the privilege of participating in the governance of the protocol.\n",
        "Orca\n",
        "The goals of Orca also focus on overcoming the pitfalls of centralized crypto exchanges, such as ensuring faster and more secure transactions. It is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges with the flexibility for trading cryptocurrencies on Solana blockchain. The most prominent feature of Orca is the innovative UI that helps users change their language settings directly from the DEX and view token balances.\n",
        "On top of that, Orca has proved to be the best pick for traders who prefer anonymity. Users can also capitalize on the advantage of trading directly from wallets and reducing the risk of losing funds to hacking or third-party mismanagement.\n",
        "Enroll now in the Solana Development Course to understand the workings of the Anchor framework, Solana Program Library, and Solana tokens.\n",
        "Vertex\n",
        "The most interesting origin story among decentralized exchanges probably belongs to Vertex. It is the perfect example of how the best-decentralized exchanges can brave any odds. Vertex was created on the Terra blockchain, which suffered a massive breakdown. However, the decentralized exchange did not stop there, and all its operations were transitioned to the Arbitrum blockchain.\n",
        "Vertex went through major changes in its overall structure and goals. One of the most interesting features of Vertex is the option for bridging to 8 different blockchains, which ensures interoperability. In addition, it also offers faster order-matching mechanisms that can improve efficiency of crypto transactions.\n",
        "Apex Protocol\n",
        "The collection of the best DEXs would be incomplete without adding the Apex protocol. It has gained popularity for offering an elastic AMM. Apex protocol is also one of the top decentralized exchanges, with the facility for order book trading. Beginners can also leverage the flexibility for spot trading on the platform.\n",
        "Another unique highlight of the Apex protocol is the Starkware layer 2 scalability mechanism that also addresses security concerns. As a matter of fact, Apex protocol has gained popularity for offering improved privacy and security features.\n",
        "How Can You Choose the Right DEXs?\n",
        "As you can notice, there are multiple decentralized exchanges in the market with innovative features. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between the best-decentralized exchanges to find the ideal choice for your requirements. Interestingly, a few factors can help you choose the best DEX according to your needs.\n",
        "First of all, you must check the blockchains on which the decentralized exchange operates, as it would dictate the level of interoperability. Another important criterion for evaluating a decentralized exchange is liquidity. Without sufficient liquidity, traders might have to face the negative consequences of slippage.\n",
        "You must also evaluate a decentralized exchange on the basis of whether it is open or permissioned. For example, certain DEXs only allow the community members to add new liquidity pools. Most importantly, you can compare the best DEXs on the basis of their security features.\n",

        "Artificial intelligence has reached a position that would be impossible to imagine a few years back. Machine learning models are capable of producing output that would have required months of work from expert data scientists. Artificial intelligence technology has helped in achieving significant wonders that would be impossible for human beings. You might wonder why you should focus on questions like “What is convolutional neural networks (CNNs)?” in discussions about artificial intelligence and ML.\n",
        "The most important reason to focus on convolutional neural networks in AI is the limitations of AI in image processing. AI models have not proved as effective as the human brain in recognizing and processing images. The human brain works in mysterious and complex ways. You could not find a definitive way to understand the cognition and rendering mechanisms of the brain. You can find different layers of interconnected neurons in the human brain. Interestingly, AI can replicate the structure of your brain with the help of artificial neurons.\n",
        "In the mid-20s, artificial neural networks gained momentum as they offered capabilities for learning from data in a theoretical manner. However, artificial neural networks had to evolve into convolutional neural networks. It was a vital necessity to adapt to the use cases of image recognition and processing. Let us learn more about convolutional neural networks and how they work.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is a Convolutional Neural Network or CNN?\n",
        "Neural networks are an important subset in the domain of machine learning. You can understand convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an important component in the world of deep learning algorithms. Neural networks include node layers featuring an input layer alongside one or multiple hidden layers and an output layer. When the output of individual nodes exceeds a specific threshold value, the node starts working and sends data to the next layer in the network. Without such procedures, it is impossible to pass data along to the next layer in the network.\n",
        "You can come across different types of neural networks that are suitable for different data types and use cases. For example, recurrent neural networks are generally used in speech recognition and natural language processing tasks. On the other hand, a convolutional neural network example would show that CNNs are generally used for computer vision tasks. CNNs can also support image classification tasks. Before the arrival of convolutional neural networks, the identification of objects in images involved time-intensive methods for feature extraction.\n",
        "Convolutional neural networks offer a scalable approach for object recognition and image classification tasks. CNNs utilize linear algebra principles, such as matrix multiplication, for effective identification of patterns in an image. However, the working of CNNs may demand excessive use of computational resources, such as graphical processing units or GPUs.\n",

        "Working Mechanism of Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
        "Another important highlight in a guide to learn convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the working mechanism of CNNs. You can learn more about the workings of CNNs by uncovering information about their architecture. Convolutional neural networks are different from other neural networks in that they have superior performance for image, audio, and speech signal inputs. The architecture of convolutional neural networks includes three layers: a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a fully-connected layer.\n",
        "It is important to note that the CNN becomes more complex with every layer and identifies larger portions in the image. The initial layers emphasize simple features, such as edges and colors. When the image data moves through different layers of the CNN, it recognizes the larger elements or shapes of objects until it identifies the desired object. Here is an outline of the different ways in which the different layers in CNNs work.\n",
        "The most integral component of a convolutional neural network is the convolutional network. The working mechanism of convolutional neural networks explained to beginners, revolves around the convolutional layer, which is the core building block of CNNs. It is the site where most of the computation works in a convolutional neural network.\n",
        "Some of the notable components in the convolutional layer include input data, feature maps, and filters. For example, the input for the convolutional layer can be a color image that includes a matrix of 3D pixels. Therefore, the input would have three different dimensions, height, depth, and width, which correlate with the RGB in the image.\n",
        "Convolutional layer also includes a feature detector or a filter. Also known as kernel, the feature detector would traverse through receptive areas of the image to check for a feature. The process that helps in recognition of objects in images is convolution.\n",
        "The feature detector in the convolutional layer of CNNs is a two-dimensional array of weights that represents different parts of the image. Although the array can vary in size, the filter size is generally a 3×3 matrix, which also determines the size of the receptive field. The filter is implemented on an area of the image, followed by calculation of a dot product between the filter and the input pixels.\n",
        "You can then feed the dot product into an output array. Subsequently, the filter would shift by a huge margin and repeat the process until the kernel covers the complete image. The final output obtained from the sequence of dot products from the input and filter serves as the feature map or activation map.\n",
        "The description of convolutional neural network introduction also emphasizes the fact that weights in the feature detector are fixed during movement through the image. Parameter sharing enables consistency in the weights of feature detector. However, some of the parameters, such as weight values, can vary during the course of training through gradient descent and backpropagation.\n",
        "On the other hand, you can find three hyper-parameters that influence the volume size of the output that you must set prior to the training of neural networks. The three hyper-parameters include a number of filters, stride, and zero-padding.\n",
        "The architecture of convolutional neural network also includes an additional convolutional layer other than initial convolution layer. It is an important tool in convolutional neural network applications as the additional convolutional layer follows the first convolutional layer.\n",
        "The structure of the convolutional neural network becomes hierarchical, and later layers can witness the pixels in receptive fields of previous layers. Finally, the convolutional layer transforms the image to numerical values, thereby helping the neural network in interpretation and extraction of relevant patterns.\n",
        "Excited to learn the fundamentals of AI applications in business? Enroll now in the AI For Business Course\n",
        "The next important layer in the architecture of CNNs refers to pooling layers or downsampling. It helps in conducting dimensionality reduction alongside reducing the number of parameters in the input. Just like the convolutional layer, the pooling layer would pass a filter throughout the complete input. However, the filter in the pooling layer does not rely on weights. On the contrary, the kernel utilizes an aggregation function to the values in the receptive field, thereby filling the output array.\n",
        "The review of pooling layer in the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) shows that you can utilize two variants of pooling. You can find two types of pooling when working with convolutional neural networks: average pooling and max pooling. When the filter moves through the input, it can choose the pixel with the maximum value for transferring to the output array in max pooling.\n",
        "Interestingly, max pooling is a commonly used approach in the pooling layer. You can understand the mechanisms of average pooling when the filter moves through the input and determines the average value in the receptive field that it should send to the output array. The pooling layer is the site in a CNN where it loses a lot of information. However, it presents multiple advantages, including reduction of complexity, reduced risks of overfitting, and improved efficiency.\n",
        "The final addition among the components in the architecture of convolutional layer networks is the fully-connected layer. As the name implies, it serves as a comprehensively connected layer in the CNNs.

The fundamentals of cryptocurrency mining explained for beginners suggest that it is an essential requirement for releasing new tokens into circulation. You can find the best explanation for cryptocurrency mining and how crypto mining works by taking the example of Bitcoin.\n",
        "On the other hand, people also think about the costs of mining cryptocurrencies, as you would need expensive mining rigs. At the same time, it is also important to consider the costs of electricity for cryptocurrency mining before investing your time and efforts in it. Let us learn more about crypto mining, using the example of Bitcoin, and whether it will still be profitable in 2024.\n",
        "Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n",
        "Understanding the Foundations of Cryptocurrency Mining\n",
        "Cryptocurrency mining refers to the process through which transactions are officially added to the blockchain network. It also helps add new cryptocurrencies to the circulation supply. Bitcoin serves as the best reference to understand ‘what is cryptocurrency mining’ as it does not depend on third parties for verifying transactions. On the contrary, it relies on Bitcoin miners for securing and confirming transactions. Bitcoin blockchain uses the Proof of Work consensus mechanism to confirm a new block of transactions.\n",
        "Miners have to compete against each other to verify the 10-minute block and earn the newly minted Bitcoin as a rewards. The existing reward for Bitcoin mining is 6.25 BTC, and according to the current prices, it can be worth more than $162,000. The process to mine cryptocurrency involves solving a cryptographic puzzle to verify a mining block. However, miners would need high-end computing hardware to solve the cryptographic puzzles. Since many miners would join the competition, the first one to solve the puzzle would win the block reward.\n",
        "Bitcoin mining, or crypto mining, is extremely competitive, and miners with the most powerful computing resources have the best chance of earning a minting reward. Apart from the upfront cost of setting up a crypto-mining machine, you should also consider other ongoing costs. For example, crypto or Bitcoin mining consumes vast amounts of electricity. On top of it, there is always the possibility of someone outpacing you to solve the puzzle and earn rewards. Therefore, the profitability of cryptocurrency mining definitely comes under question in the crypto industry.\n",
        "Enroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.\n",
        "Unraveling the Basics of the Working of Crypto Mining\n",
        "Cryptocurrency mining, or Bitcoin mining, is a complex effort and requires a significant upfront investment. Therefore, it is important to understand how crypto mining works before you proceed towards becoming a miner. You must take a look at the following aspects of the working mechanism of crypto or Bitcoin mining.\n",
        "Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and don’t work under the control of a single individual or entity. It is different from the traditional payment systems. Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work consensus mechanism to verify and process transactions without involving an intermediary.\n",
        "Proof of Work consensus leverages cryptography to maintain security and decentralization of transactions. It calls for solving a cryptographic equation to verify correctness of transactions. There are many cryptocurrencies that use Proof of Work consensus mechanism, such as Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Dogecoin, and Monero.\n",
        "Another important detail that comes up in discussions around ‘Is crypto mining worth it?’ is the hashing power. It is the amount of computational power that crypto miners can generate. With more computational power, miners can make more calculations when they try to solve the cryptographic equations. In the case of Bitcoin, miners would need 10 minutes to solve the cryptographic puzzles.\n",
        "During these 10 minutes, miners can leverage a ‘trial and error’ process. The hashing power of a miner determines the speed and the number of attempts miners can make for the ‘trial and error’ process. However, you would require more energy for more hashing power, thereby increasing the cost of crypto mining. On top of that, there is no way to guarantee that you will be 100% successful in earning the mining reward.\n",
        "Cryptocurrency mining puzzles are difficult and complex for humans. The workings of cryptocurrency mining explained to beginners cite the necessity of high-end mining equipment. It can help generate the hashing power required to solve the cryptographic equations and add blocks of transaction to the network. The growing popularity of Bitcoin has led to a rise in the difficulty of mining operations.\n",
        "Therefore, mining equipment for crypto mining changed from CPUs to GPUs and then to application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. ASICs offer unparalleled speed and can generate massive amounts of hashing power for crypto mining. However, it is important to note that advanced ASICs cost thousands of dollars, and you would need more than one ASIC device for successful crypto mining.\n",
        "Excited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n",
        "The next crucial thing that you must learn about cryptocurrency mining is the difficulty of the mining process. The definitions for ‘what is cryptocurrency mining’ reflect briefly on how it can be a difficult process with cryptographic puzzles. Mining difficulty refers to the complexity of the cryptographic puzzle that you must solve for the mining process.\n",
        "Faster mining of blocks can compromise the security of Bitcoin blockchain. On the other hand, the network would become inefficient when the mining process takes more time. Therefore, Bitcoin automatically adjusts the mining difficulty to achieve its 10-minute block target. In the case of Bitcoin, the mining difficulty is adjusted at a period of almost 14 days.\n",
        "The best thing to find answers to “Is crypto mining worth it?” is the rewards that you get for crypto mining. The first miner to solve the cryptographic puzzle wins the mining reward in the form of newly mined Bitcoins. Initially, the mining reward for Bitcoin miners was 50 BTC initially.\n",
        "However, the Bitcoin halving event reduces the mining rewards by half every four years. The last halving in 2020 reduced the mining rewards to 6.25 BTC, which is still the norm. With 2024 already here, Bitcoin miners can expect the reward to drop by half once again.\n",
        "Want to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course\n",
        "Changing Trends in Profitability with Crypto Mining\n",
        "If you are thinking about the profitability of crypto mining, then you must be disappointed. The Bitcoin halving phenomenon would bring down the mining rewards to half of 6.25 BTC. However, the rewards for the mine cryptocurrency would still be higher as the mining reward would be more than $80,000 according to existing Bitcoin and USD prices. On the other hand, it is important to note that cryptocurrency mining is almost similar to mining physical assets, such as gold, in some ways. Growing asset prices imply more profitability of crypto mining.\n",
        "At the same time, it is also important to consider different factors other than the price of cryptocurrencies to evaluate profitability of Bitcoin mining. For example, rising prices of electricity, energy, and gas are some factors that influence profitability of cryptocurrency mining. Bitcoin mining requires a significant amount of electricity consumption in a year, which can surpass the annual energy consumption of a small country like Norway. Is cryptocurrency mining profitable amidst these trends? Interestingly, there are some trends that indicate that crypto mining will still be a profitable venture in 2024.\n",
        "The cost of crypto mining equipment is one of the major aspects of how crypto mining works and the rewards it can offer miners. However, the price of ASIC devices reached all-time highs in 2022, with each unit selling for almost $10,000 to $18,000. Interestingly, the price of ASIC devices has declined by around 70%, thereby indicating favorable trends for mining profitability. On top of it, reduced Bitcoin prices encourage less efficient miners to shut down their operations. Therefore, more efficient miners can achieve more profitability with the fall of Bitcoin prices.\n",
        "Network hashrate or hashing power is also one of the notable factors that determine cryptocurrency mining profitability. The hashrate of a crypto mining machine represents the number of calculations it can perform in one second. You can find out the profitability of Bitcoin mining in the form of hash price, represented in the form of USD/TH or terahashes per second per day.\n",
        "Some of the prominent influences on the hashing price include Bitcoin price, transaction fees, block subsidy, and network difficulty. Interestingly, it is important to note that the total mining activity is still at an all-time high despite the drop in profitability of Bitcoin mining.\n",

        "The complexities in cryptocurrency mining have created a lot of doubts about the effectiveness of the process. Most importantly, it is important to note that you cannot be completely sure about receiving rewards for mining. You can mine cryptocurrency with assurance of better profitability by following certain best practices. Here are the most effective strategies recommended for profitable crypto mining in 2024.\n",
        "ASICs are the most trusted tools for achieving maximum profits from crypto mining. However, it is important to verify the authenticity of the mining equipment before you buy and use them.\n",
        "Cloud mining is also another trusted method for reducing the costs of cryptocurrency mining. It allows users to rent hardware for mining without the resources and technical expertise required for mining operations.\n",
        "Some of the guides on cryptocurrency mining explained for beginners also point toward the possibilities for using mining pools. Mining pools help miners in combining their resources to increase the probabilities of mining blocks. In addition, mining pools offer lower returns, albeit with the assurance of more consistency.\n",
        "Cryptocurrency market is significantly volatile, and the prices could change drastically. Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the crypto market and the changing prices to modify your mining strategies to achieve more profits.\n",

        "Most of the discussions about cryptocurrencies point towards their exponential value appreciations or the revolutionary impact of cryptocurrencies on finance. However, a new theme has become a crucial part of discussions on cryptocurrencies, which revolves around their environmental impact. You must have come across articles citing the fact that Bitcoin and blockchain technology are not good for the environment. Therefore, the world needs the best green cryptocurrencies to tackle such accusations.\n",
        "For starters, Bitcoin did not leave any room for arguments against the harmful impact of cryptocurrencies on the environment. It uses the energy-intensive Proof of Work consensus mechanism, which does not exactly spell good news for the environment. However, all blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies don’t deserve to be painted in a negative light due to the limitations of Bitcoin. Let us learn more about some of the popular green cryptocurrencies in 2024.\n",
        "Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n",
        "Why Does the World Need Green Cryptocurrencies?\n",
        "Cryptocurrencies work on blockchain networks, and traditional blockchains have been accused of consuming massive amounts of energy. For example, the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index reports that Bitcoin mining requires more than 140 terawatt hours annually. It may look like a meagre number on paper. However, it exceeds the annual energy consumption of a country like Norway, thereby reflecting the urgency of the situation.\n",
        "On the other hand, a continuously expanding eco-friendly cryptocurrency list might offer a silver lining for the cryptocurrency industry. There are many blockchain networks that have a steadfast commitment to ensure efficient use of energy. For example, Solana and Cardano consume considerably less energy than the conventional networks.\n",
        "Environmentalists and crypto enthusiasts have been worried about the levels of computer processing power required for mining cryptocurrencies. The mining process generally requires high-end computers to verify transactions. On top of that, blockchain networks need massive amounts of electricity to power complex algorithms. At the same time, it is also important to consider the usage of non-renewable energy sources to provide electricity for blockchain networks. Therefore, it is important to look for green cryptocurrencies that can offer hope for sustainability.\n",
        "Get familiar with the terms related to cryptocurrency with Cryptocurrency Flashcards.\n",
        "How Can Green Cryptocurrencies Make a Difference?\n",
        "The concerns regarding negative impact of cryptocurrencies on the environment can deter the prospects for their adoption. The top green cryptocurrencies can solve this problem by focusing more on environmental sustainability. You might wonder about the secret ingredient that can transform cryptocurrencies from energy-consuming giants to energy-efficient tools.\n",
        "Interestingly, you can find a major difference in the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies with a change in their consensus mechanism. Most of the descriptions of green cryptocurrencies point to the consensus method they use to verify and add transactions to the network.\n",
        "The two most popular consensus mechanisms are Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, which offer better energy efficiency. As a matter of fact, Ethereum transitioned to the Proof of Stake consensus from Proof of Work with “The Merge.”\n",
        "It helped reduce network energy consumption by almost 99.9%, and now, Ethereum consumes less energy in a year than PayPal. Your search for the most energy-efficient cryptocurrency would also guide you to the differences between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake consensus. Here is a brief breakdown of each consensus mechanism to help you understand the differences between them.\n",
        "Proof of Work requires thousands of crypto miners to work tirelessly to solve complex mathematical problems. Miners compete with each other to solve the problems first and add blocks to the blockchain to earn crypto rewards. Therefore, miners invest in high-end computational power to have a competitive edge over other miners. However, the advanced mining rigs lead to massive energy usage alongside a huge carbon footprint.\n",
        "Proof of Stake consensus differs from Proof of Work as it reduces the need for computational power. It uses the concept of validators, selected on the basis of the number of coins they hold or they want to stake as collateral. Proof of Stake works more like a digital lottery and does not require high-end computing resources to validate transactions. As a result, it offers an effective solution for fuelling the green cryptocurrency revolution.\n",

        "Another top name among popular green cryptocurrencies is Cardano. It is the most important addition to an eco-friendly cryptocurrency list due to its unique Ouroboros protocol. It is the first verifiable, secure, and peer-reviewed blockchain consensus based on Proof of Stake consensus. The Ouroboros protocol ensures lower energy consumption without requiring users to participate in a competitive mining race.\n",
        "Most importantly, it achieves a drastic reduction in energy usage without compromising decentralization or security. As a matter of fact, analysts have pointed out that Cardano is 47000 times more energy efficient than the Bitcoin blockchain. Furthermore, the themes of environmental consciousness in its roadmap also establish Cardano’s prowess in fueling sustainability in cryptocurrencies.\n",
        "Hedera Hashgraph, or HBAR, can be treated as a revolutionary player in the domain of green cryptocurrencies. It qualifies as an answer to queries like “What crypto is best for the environment?” for its unique consensus mechanism. Hashgraph serves as a valuable consensus mechanism to achieve enhanced transaction speed with low energy usage.\n",
        "However, Hedera’s efforts to encourage sustainability in the crypto industry are not limited to its consensus mechanism. Hedera works in partnership with the Crypto Climate Accord to ensure that it becomes carbon-negative through carbon credit programs and carbon offsetting.\n",
        "According to the University College of London Blockchain Centre, Hedera might be one of the most energy-efficient blockchain networks. On the contrary, it is significantly smaller in size and registers comparatively less smart contract activity than other green networks. Therefore, it might take some time to gain the top spot among popular green cryptocurrencies.\n",
        "The additions to a green cryptocurrencies list would also include Algorand or ALGO. It was created with the vision to challenge the conventional designs of cryptocurrencies. Algorand stands out as a popular green crypto alternative due to the emphasis on sustainability in its design. The network uses the pure Proof of Stake or PPoS consensus mechanism that guarantees the participation of every token holder in the block validation spirit.\n",
        "The pure PoS model offers security and decentralization alongside the benefit of better energy efficiency. Just like many other green cryptocurrencies, Algorand actively advocates for initiatives that help it achieve its goal of becoming a green cryptocurrency. For example, it supports carbon offset programs and encourages collaborations that can support environmental conservation.

Market reports have suggested that the DeFi market could grow beyond $232 billion by 2030. Businesses want to capitalize on the benefits of DeFi for simplifying financial transactions for their customers.\n",
        "DeFi, or decentralized finance, has been responsible for the transition of conventional processes in the domain of finance toward decentralized networks. Businesses can build a DeFi app for different reasons, including the development of new financial services solutions and offering new methods for conducting financial transactions. The most interesting thing about DeFi is the broader scope of opportunities associated with it. One of the major objectives of DeFi is the removal of intermediaries and emphasizing technology above everything else. Let us find out how you can build DeFi apps from scratch in the following DeFi development guide.\n",
        "Enroll now in the DeFi Development Course to understand the best ways to use DeFi development tools like Solidity, React, and Hardhat.\n",
        "What are DeFi Applications?\n",
        "One of the first things that you should learn about decentralized finance development is the utility of DeFi apps. Decentralized finance or DeFi points at financial instruments, including services and applications developed on blockchain. DeFi solutions were created as an alternative to the traditional banking sector and to replace traditional financial services with modern technologies with the help of open-source protocols. Decentralized finance works with the help of blockchain technology and smart contracts to offer more transparent and accessible financial solutions. DeFi offers opportunities for interaction with cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and NFTs.\n",
        "Imagine the possibilities of having a world where financial services are immediately accessible at your fingertips.

Decentralized finance utilizes blockchain to offer a borderless approach in the domain of finance. You can take a loan, speculate on price shifts, obtain secure risk insurance, and trade in digital currencies with the help of DeFi.\n",
        "Learn about DeFi applications and how these work with the presentation on Top 5 DeFi Applications\n",
        "Important Traits of DeFi Application\n",
        "DeFi apps work by using blockchain technology, which offers a decentralized network that takes information in the form of blocks. The data blocks or blocks of transactions are chronologically arranged on a chain with the help of timestamps. As a result, the information becomes immutable, and the transactions become irreversible. The responses to “How do I start a DeFi development?” would also suggest that you must know the ways in which blockchain ensures public accessibility of the network. It can ensure the dependability and transparency of transactions associated with DeFi. What are the other aspects that separate DeFi applications from the crowd?\n",
        "Conventional financial frameworks have ruled the domain of finance. You can learn the DeFi development guide to create solutions that can address the setbacks of centralized finance. The most critical setback of centralized finance is the involvement of central entities or institutions in the management and regulation of financial transactions. With the help of decentralization, DeFi apps reduce the dependency on intermediaries. It can help in creating an ecosystem that revolves around the elements of trust and transparency. Users can gain control over their transactions and remove potential setbacks with the help of DeFi.\n",
        "Another important trait of DeFi apps points to interoperability, as DeFi protocols can interact with each other. It could help offer feature sharing, straightforward asset trading, and data exchange. Interoperability opens the doors for developing compound applications in which DeFi protocols can capitalize on the attributes of other protocols. As a result, interoperability empowers the rise of perspectives on developing a tightly knit and diverse DeFi ecosystem.\n",
        "The next crucial aspect you must understand to build a DeFi app is the assurance of non-custodial control. DeFi applications allow users to have non-custodial control over their assets. It means that users would have complete authority and ownership over their funds in all financial transactions. DeFi apps rely on smart contracts to ensure that users are in control of their assets.\n",
        "DeFi applications utilize smart contracts that operate on blockchain networks. Smart contracts serve an important role in the automation of financial transactions and other tasks for DeFi. Developers can use autonomous smart contracts to enable complex financial tasks. In addition, decentralized finance development ensures that all financial operations work seamlessly. Furthermore, smart contracts can also adapt to different types of circumstances and requirements for offering financial services.\n",
        "The list of distinctive traits of DeFi apps also draws attention to the capability of DeFi apps for liquidity provision. DeFi platforms help users in depositing their assets in liquidity pools to obtain reward tokens or interest. The pooled resources facilitate liquidity to the DeFi platforms to enable borrowing and seamless trading operations. With a decentralized approach, the liquidity provision in DeFi apps is considerably different from traditional finance methodologies.\n",
        "\n",
        "What are the Important Functionalities of DeFi Apps?\n",
        "The most notable highlight of a DeFi development guide is the description of the functionalities you need in DeFi apps. Apart from the benefits of independence and decentralization, DeFi applications can help in serving a broad range of applications. The use cases of DeFi prioritize the transformation of conventional financial processes. Here is an outline of the different functionalities of DeFi.\n",
        "Stablecoins represent a stable group of assets in the DeFi landscape. The riskiest trait of any cryptocurrency is the higher volatility, which creates confusion for investors. Stablecoins work by pegging their value to reserve assets, which makes them one of the most revolutionary crypto assets.\n",
        "DeFi tokens mined on pre-existing blockchains are also an important aspect you would come across when you learn DeFi development best practices. In addition, DeFi tokens can be pegged against an underlying asset, such as fiat currency or gold.\n",
        "Liquidity mining is also an important highlight in the DeFi ecosystem. Also known as yield farming, it involves the use of cryptocurrencies to facilitate liquidity. For example, decentralized exchanges utilize Automated Market Maker to facilitate effective regulation of trading activities. Users can swap tokens for trading cryptocurrencies in the liquidity pool to earn passive income.\n",
        "DeFi exchanges can help users in trading cryptocurrencies without the involvement of third-party intermediaries. The DeFi exchange apps leverage smart contracts to enable peer-to-peer and direct trading.\n",
        "The functionalities of DeFi also include staking, which utilizes idle coins to support the validation of cryptographic transactions. You must learn that staking is possible with the Proof of Stake consensus that focuses on ownership stake rather than the proof of work.\n",
        "People who want to find answers to “How do I start a DeFi development?” must also pay attention to the functionalities of borrowing and lending in DeFi apps. DeFi has been creating different alternatives to traditional finance use cases, and lending and borrowing apps are one of the top examples of this. Smart contracts serve as the technological intermediary in such apps, thereby ensuring that the lenders and borrowers follow all the conditions.\n",
        "The DeFi ecosystem also includes wallets as one of the notable additions for exploring a different perspective on decentralized finance. Cryptocurrencies are still in the initial stage and need central authorities, such as a digital wallet. Digital wallets are responsible for holding the key in the process of exchanging cryptocurrencies. DeFi wallets could help users exercise complete control over their assets and keys.\n",

On top of it, you would have to rely on frontend development frameworks such as React and backend development frameworks such as NodeJS and Java. DeFi development projects also require database technologies in the tech stack, such as NoSQL, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. You must also emphasize the web3.js or ethers.js frameworks for UI development.\n",
        "You should provide a clear definition of app architecture after determining the tech stack for DeFi development. Developers seeking answers to “How do I start a DeFi development?” must define the low-level and high-level architecture of DeFi application. In addition, the architecture defines the frontend and backend functionalities alongside offering clarity on how smart contracts ensure governance for financial transactions. You must also outline the functionalities and features that you want in the DeFi app to support desired use cases.\n",
        "User experience not only focuses on the aesthetics of the app but also on mapping the journey of a user to ensure effective engagement. During the design of UI, developers must consider the ways in which users can access different functionalities and features. Developers must create sketches of user flows to design the ideal user interface of DeFi apps that can help in performing the primary tasks. You must also emphasize functional usability testing to ensure that DeFi apps offer an inclusive experience to all users.\n",
        "The security posture of DeFi apps is one of the biggest concerns for a developer. You have to pay attention to essential best practices for ensuring security as you learn DeFi development. Developers should pay attention to carefully scripting the code for smart contract development. In addition, you must also release the patches for developing intelligent contracts and implementing vulnerability assessments.\n",

        "Cryptocurrencies are no longer limited to the tables of tech enthusiasts. The initial fears regarding losing money to cryptocurrency value fluctuations created many doubts in the minds of users. However, the popularity of Bitcoin soared by huge margins in a limited period of time, thereby encouraging more people to pay attention to cryptocurrencies.\n",
        "Interestingly, the popularity of Bitcoin is one of the reasons for growth in momentum of the Bitcoin vs. Altcoins debate due to the rise of many altcoins. Cryptocurrencies have become one of the major topics in mainstream discussions on finance and have become the frontrunners of a revolutionary change in the financial services landscape. Let us take a look at the differences between Bitcoin and altcoins to find the better alternative among them.\n",
        "Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n",
        "Fundamentals of Bitcoin\n",
        "The first thing you need to learn before comparing Bitcoin with altcoins is the awareness of Bitcoin fundamentals. You can find effective answers to the question, “Is Bitcoin better than altcoins?” by learning about the fundamental identity of Bitcoin. The origins of Bitcoin changed the cryptocurrency landscape and showed that virtual currencies can be decentralized.\n",
        "Satoshi Nakamoto transformed the conventional notions about money with his new invention in 2009 and provided the foundations for rise of a massive industry. Bitcoin is the first-ever cryptocurrency, and it is still one of the most valuable and recognized digital currencies in the market today.\n",
        "Bitcoin works through the power of blockchain technology. It offers a public distributed ledger that includes transaction data from everyone using Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain allows addition of transactions to the blocks, which are subsequently linked to a chain of blocks featuring previous Bitcoin transactions.\n",
        "You can understand the debate on altcoins vs. Bitcoin more clearly by identifying how Bitcoin provided one of the earliest forms of virtual currency based on blockchain. As a matter of fact, the world embraced the concept of blockchain after learning about working mechanism of Bitcoin.\n",
        "Every transaction on Bitcoin blockchain is verifiable. Bitcoin network also leverages encryption that helps individuals all over the world exchange information and engage in financial transactions. At the same time, Bitcoin opened the doors for anonymous and secure transactions.\n",
        "The relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins also emphasizes the element of decentralization. Without the governance of a central authority, Bitcoin is free from unwanted influence. Another important trait of Bitcoin is its limited supply, which is fixed at 21 million BTC. As a result, Bitcoin has become a scarce asset, and its value has increased with time.\n",
        "Enroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks\n",
        "Fundamentals of Altcoins\n",
        "Bitcoin started a revolution of cryptocurrencies and pushed for the rise of new types of cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins. Any review of Bitcoin and altcoins emphasizes the fact that any type of cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin can be classified as altcoins. Many altcoins have arrived in the market following a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain and other blockchains such as Ethereum. The primary objective of altcoins revolves around resolution of specific issues, such as security limitations and problems with transaction speed.\n",
        "One of the first examples of altcoins is Litecoin. It was a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain network and was formed in 2011. Without the presence of a substantial number of competitors to Bitcoin, the term ‘altcoin’ became the top choice for describing new arrivals in the cryptocurrency market. Apart from Ethereum, many other altcoins made their mark in the industry. Some of the popular examples of altcoins with high market capitalization include Binance Smart Chain and Ripple.\n",
        "The difference between altcoins and Bitcoin also invites attention to the classification of altcoins into different categories. The most popular variants of altcoins include stablecoins, utility tokens, and security tokens. Each type of altcoin has a distinct functionality and plays a vital role in strengthening the web3 ecosystem. Stablecoins are one of the most popular types of altcoins, which have been pegged to another asset with a fixed value. The most popular examples of stablecoins include USD Coin and Tether or USDT.\n",
        "Altcoin variants also include utility tokens and security tokens. Utility tokens are used on specific blockchains as payment tokens or for the execution of specific tasks and access to particular features on the platform. On the other hand, security tokens are altcoins that serve as digital representations of physical assets. Security tokens can also represent digital contracts that offer ownership of physical assets such as homes, cars, or stocks.\n",

        "Comparison between Bitcoin and Altcoins\n",
        "The fundamentals of altcoins and Bitcoin provided a brief overview of the differences between them. You can explore the Bitcoin vs. altcoins comparison from many other perspectives. For example, you can compare Bitcoin with altcoins on the basis of their purpose or dominance over the market.\n",
        "Bitcoin is the most popular and biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market share, closely followed by Ethereum. Altcoins build up the rest of the crypto market. Bitcoin is a well-established alternative for investors and has occupied a larger market share. On the other hand, altcoins might have lower valuations, albeit with expanded scope for innovation and experimentation. Such comparisons between altcoins and Bitcoin can help you determine which one of them would be useful for crypto and web3. Here are some of the notable differences between altcoins and Bitcoin based on different parameters.\n",
        "The most obvious factors for comparing Bitcoin with altcoins include market capitalization and popularity. You can find answers to the question, “Is Bitcoin better than altcoins?” by reviewing the market capitalization. For Bitcoin, you can find a massive market capitalization ranging beyond $1 trillion.\n",
        "It is one of the most popular assets among crypto investors. In addition, Bitcoin has gained widespread adoption across the world and can be used to purchase products and services. As a matter of fact, many big companies accept Bitcoin as payment for their products and services.\n",
        "On the other hand, altcoins have to pass through certain challenges before they reach the level of Bitcoin. The combined market capitalization of altcoins cannot compete with that of Bitcoin. At the same time, altcoins are not as popular as Bitcoin all over the world.\n",
        "However, it is impossible to write off the potential of altcoins such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. You must have noticed how these altcoins have gained traction and substantial improvements in market share in recent times.\n",
        "Want to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course.\n",
        "Bitcoin has been tailored as a decentralized virtual currency only. The primary purpose of Bitcoin revolves around ensuring anonymous and secure peer-to-peer transactions. The comparison between altcoins vs. Bitcoin largely focuses on how Bitcoin was created to serve as an alternative to conventional financial systems. On the other hand, altcoins can introduce new and innovative technologies alongside novel functionalities. The purpose of altcoins extends beyond serving as tools for simple transactions.\n",
        "You can discover more about the element of purpose in a debate between altcoins and Bitcoin using the example of Ethereum. Ethereum serves as a useful tool for creating smart contracts that can go through automatic execution by referring to predefined conditions. On top of it, altcoins can cater to a broad range of use cases with benefits of faster transactions or representation of real-world assets.\n",
        "The next crucial point of difference between Bitcoin and altcoins focuses on the technology foundation they use. It is important to note that altcoins and Bitcoin leverage mining as the primary tools for transaction validation and addition of new blocks. At the same time, you must note that altcoins and Bitcoin can have different mining processes and consensus mechanisms.\n",
        "Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work or PoW consensus algorithm to validate transactions. The Proof of Work consensus demands the use of complex computation resources and intensive energy consumption to solve mathematical puzzles and validate transactions.\n",
        "The Proof of Work consensus used in Bitcoin serves as a major highlight in the altcoins vs. Bitcoin debate as it creates higher fees and longer transaction times. Altcoins can also utilize different consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Stake, Proof of Authority, and Delegated Proof of Stake. The different consensus mechanisms used by altcoins provide the guarantee for improved scalability, faster transaction times, and lower transaction fees.\n",
        "Embrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path.\n",
        "Final Words\n",
        "The relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins shows that both of them are vital for the growth of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. As a matter of fact, altcoins and Bitcoin have a significant influence on the future of the web3 ecosystem. The differences between altcoins and Bitcoins reflect the fact that Bitcoin enjoys more popularity and market share.\n",
        "On the other hand, altcoins play a crucial role in expanding the use cases of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to solve different issues. Learn more about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, altcoins, and web3 to explore their role in shaping the future of technology.\n",

        "Responsible AI encourages a culture of responsible innovation by empowering AI developers and decision-makers to follow ethical considerations. It can help them find new and innovative ways to help you make the most of AI. Most important of all, businesses can use responsible AI as a value proposition for enhancing trust of customers in AI.\n",
        "The biggest threat to the adoption of AI systems in business use cases is the lack of trust. If businesses choose AI products that align with principles of responsible AI, then they can garner the trust of users. The most prominent advantage of using responsible AI is the assurance of safer and more accountable products.\n",
        "Want to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course!\n",

        "Artificial intelligence and machine learning models might have to follow different principles that vary from one business to another. However, it is reasonable to have doubts regarding responsible AI principles and identifying the best ones for your business. For example, you can come across a distinct set of principles for responsible artificial intelligence by Microsoft and Google.\n",
        "On top of that, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has also published an AI Risk Management Framework that includes most of the principles of Microsoft and Google. Here is an overview of the top principles recommended by Google for responsible artificial intelligence development.\n",
        "The foremost highlight among principles in a responsible AI guide is the social utility of AI. Advancements in artificial intelligence would have a major transformative impact across different industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, energy, entertainment, transportation, and security. It is important to consider the social and economic factors in the use cases of AI technologies to check whether the potential benefits outweigh the setbacks and risks.\n",
        "Artificial intelligence also offers improvements in the ability to understand the meaning of content. Developers must ensure that users get high-quality and accurate information while respecting the cultural, legal, and social norms of the country where they have to deploy AI systems.\n",
        "Another notable principle for responsible AI is bias mitigation. Most of the responses to “What is a responsible artificial intelligence?” revolve around reducing bias. AI algorithms and training data can reinforce, reflect, and reduce unfair biases. However, it is not simple to differentiate between fair and unfair biases as they can differ significantly across different societies and cultures.\n",
        "Therefore, it is important to pay attention to avoiding unjust impact of AI on people, particularly the ones who have sensitive characteristics. AI systems must be designed to treat people equally and positively irrespective of race, gender, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political beliefs, religious beliefs, and income.\n",
        "The list of principles for designing responsible AI systems also includes safety. Developers must implement strong security and safety practices to address the concerns of unintended results that may increase the risks of harm to users. Most of the responsible AI examples show that developers must create AI systems with caution in accordance with best practices for AI security. On top of that, developers must also verify the security of AI technologies in constrained environments and ensure the monitoring of their operation after deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The development of AI systems must also align with the principle of accountability. Developers can create the designs of AI systems with an emphasis on responsible AI by enabling relevant opportunities for feedback and appeal. The AI system must also provide a detailed explanation of its working mechanisms. Responsible AI systems must also be subject to direct human control and direction.\n",
        "Discussions about responsible AI would be incomplete without drawing attention to the implications of privacy. It is one of the most noticeable responsible AI principles for developing and using AI technologies in different sectors. Developers must create AI systems that offer the opportunity to obtain consent of users and notify them about the data being collected. In addition, AI systems must also adopt architectures that feature privacy safeguards and offer comprehensive control over data usage.\n",
        "The list of principles for responsible AI development by Google also includes the necessity of safeguarding standards for scientific excellence. Technological innovation in the domain of AI is possible only through commitment to collaboration, open inquiry, integrity, and intellectual rigor.\n",
        "AI tools have also shown the potential to open new avenues of scientific research and knowledge in prominent fields such as biology, medicine, environmental sciences, and chemistry. Therefore, AI systems must commit to the highest levels of scientific excellence to ensure that they work according to people’s expectations.\n",
        "Another notable entry in the principles for responsible AI is availability. Anyone who wants to learn responsible artificial intelligence must recognize that AI has multiple use cases. It is important to limit the negative or potentially harmful applications of AI. What are the factors you must consider to have responsible AI systems available to users? It is important to check for the primary objective and utility of AI systems alongside their nature and unique highlights. On top of it, you must also consider the scale of the technology and its impact on users.\n",

        "Understand What Responsible AI Does Not Mean\n",
        "The scope of responsible AI is not all about adhering to the principles and standards followed in a specific business or industry. It is also important to ensure that responsible artificial intelligence also avoids the activities it was never meant to do. In some cases, technology can cause some form of harm. However, responsible AI design ensures that the benefits of AI systems would outweigh the risks.\n",
        "AI should never be used for weapons or other technologies which aim at injuring people. Artificial intelligence should not be used for technologies that collect or use information for surveillance by breaking internationally accepted norms. AI should never be used for technologies whose objectives can contradict the widely accepted standards for international human rights and laws.\n",

On the contrary, AI systems must follow a white-box development model that provides a clear explanation for all AI system decisions.\n",
        "Identify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n",
        "Need for Standardization of Responsible AI\n",
        "You can come across multiple responses to “What is a responsible artificial intelligence?” as the answer would differ from company to company. However, the lack of standardization in definition of responsible AI and AI regulations is a formidable challenge for AI adoption. Therefore, it is important to bring standard frameworks that can govern the use of AI systems by businesses and consumers worldwide without conflicts.\n",
        "Take your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n",
        "Final Words\n",
        "The review of important principles associated with responsible artificial intelligence and its significance reveals that it is an inevitable necessity.

        "The two most prominent techniques that define the functionalities of large language models or LLMs include fine-tuning and transfer learning. Each technique is useful for pre-trained large language models. Before diving into the transfer learning vs fine-tuning debate, it is important to note that both approaches help users leverage the knowledge in pre-trained models.\n",
        "Interestingly, you must note that transfer learning is also a type of fine-tuning, and the best way to explain it is to consider it full fine-tuning. Even if they are interconnected, transfer learning and fine-tuning serve distinct objectives for training fundamental LLMs. Let us learn more about the differences between them with detailed impression of the implications of both techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition of Transfer Learning\n",
        "The best way to find answers to “What is the difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning?” involves learning about the two techniques. Transfer learning is an important concept in the use of large language models or LLMs. It involves the use of pre-trained LLMs on new tasks. Transfer learning leverages the existing pre-trained LLMs from LLM families such as GPT, BERT, and others who were trained for a specific task.\n",
        "For example, BERT is tailored for Natural Language Understanding, while GPT is created for Natural Language Generation. Transfer learning takes these LLMs and tailors them for a different target task with prominent similarities. The target task can be a domain-specific variation of the source task.\n",
        "The primary objective in transfer learning revolves around using the knowledge obtained from the source task to achieve enhanced performance on target tasks. It is useful in scenarios where you have limited labeled data to achieve the target task. You must also note that you don’t have to pre-train the LLM from scratch.\n",
        "You can dive deeper into the transfer learning vs. fine-tuning comparison by accounting for the training scope in transfer learning. In transfer learning, only the latter layers, including the parameters of the model, are selected for training. On the other hand, the early layers and the related parameters are frozen as they represent universal features such as textures and edges.\n",
        "The training method used in transfer learning is also known as parameter-efficient fine-tuning or PEFT. It is important to note that PEFT techniques freeze almost all the parameters of the pre-trained parameter. On the other hand, the techniques only implement fine-tuning for a restricted set of parameters. You must also remember that transfer learning involves a limited number of strategies, such as PEFT methods.\n",

        "Working Mechanism of Transfer Learning\n",
        "The most important highlight required to uncover insights on the fine-tuning vs. transfer learning debate refers to the working of transfer learning. You can understand the working mechanism of transfer learning in three distinct stages. The first stage in the working of transfer learning involves identification of the pre-trained LLM. You should choose a pre-trained model that has used a large dataset for training to address tasks in a general domain. For example, a BERT model.\n",
        "In the next stage, you have to determine the target task for which you want to implement transfer learning on the LLM. Make sure that the task aligns with the source task in some form. For example, it could be about classification of contract documents or resumes for recruiters. The final stage of training LLMs through transfer learning involves performing domain adaptation. You can use the pre-trained model as an initial point for target task. According to the complexity of the problem, you might have to freeze some layers of model or ensure that they don’t have any updates to associated parameters.\n",
        "The working mechanism of transfer learning provides a clear impression of the advantages you can find with it. You can understand the fine-tuning transfer learning comparisons easily by considering the benefits of transfer learning. Transfer learning offers promising advantages such as enhancements in efficiency, performance, and speed.\n",
        "You can notice how transfer learning reduces the requirement of extensive data in the target task, thereby improving efficiency. At the same time, it also ensures a reduction of training time as you work with pre-trained models. Most importantly, transfer learning can help achieve better performance in use cases where the target task can access limited labeled data.\n",

        "Definition of Fine-Tuning\n",
        "As you move further in exploring the difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning, it is important to learn about the next player in the game. Fine-tuning or full fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful tool in the domain of LLM training. Full fine-tuning focuses on using pre-trained models that have been trained using large datasets. It focuses on tailoring the models to work on a specific task through continuation of the training process on smaller, task-centric datasets.\n",
        "Working Mechanism of Fine-Tuning\n",
        "The high-level overview of the fine-tuning for LLMs involves updating all model parameters using supervised learning. You can find better clarity in responses to “What is the difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning?” by familiarizing yourself with how fine-tuning works.\n",
        "The first step in the process of fine-tuning LLMs begins with the identification of a pre-trained LLM. In the next step, you have to work on determining the task. The final stage in the process of fine-tuning involves adjusting weights of pre-trained model to achieve desired performance in the new task.\n",
        "Full fine-tuning depends on a massive amount of computational resources, such as GPU RAM. It can have a significant influence on the overall computing budget. Transfer learning, or PEFT, helps reduce computing and memory costs with the frozen foundation model parameters. PEFT techniques rely on fine-tuning a limited assortment of new model parameters, thereby offering better efficiency.\n",
        "Take your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n",
        "How is Transfer Learning Different from Fine Tuning?\n",
        "Large Language Models are one of the focal elements in the continuously expanding artificial intelligence ecosystem. At the same time, it is also important to note that LLMs have been evolving, and fundamental research into their potential provides the foundation for new LLM use cases.\n",
        "The growing emphasis on transfer learning vs. fine-tuning comparisons showcases how the methods for tailoring LLMs to achieve specific tasks are major highlights for the AI industry. Here is an in-depth comparison between transfer learning and fine-tuning to find out which approach is the best for LLMs.\n",
        "The foremost factor in a comparison between transfer learning and fine-tuning is the working principle. Transfer learning involves training a small subset of the model parameters or a limited number of task-specific layers. The most noticeable theme in every fine-tuning vs. transfer learning debate is the way transfer learning involves freezing most of the model parameters. The most popular strategy for transfer learning is the PEFT technique.\n",
        "Full fine-tuning works on a completely opposite principle by updating all parameters of the pre-trained model over the course of the training process. How? The weights of each layer in the model go through modifications on the basis of new training data. Fine-tuning brings crucial modifications in the behavior of a model and its performance, with specific emphasis on accuracy. The process ensures that the LLM precisely adapts to the specific dataset or task, albeit with consumption of more computing resources.\n",
        "The difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning is clearly visible in their goals. The objective of transfer learning emphasizes adapting the pre-trained model to a specific task without major changes in model parameters. With such an approach, transfer learning helps maintain a balance between retaining the knowledge gained during pre-training and adapting to the new task. It focuses on minimal task-specific adjustments to get the job done.\n",
        "The objective of fine-tuning emphasizes changing the complete pre-trained model to adapt to new datasets or tasks. The primary goals of fine-tuning LLMs revolve around achieving maximum performance and accuracy for achieving a specific task.\n",

        "You can also differentiate fine-tuning from transfer learning by learning how they affect model architecture. The answers to “What is the difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning?” emphasize the ways in which transfer learning works only on the existing architecture. It involves freezing most of the model parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of parameters.\n",
        "Full fine-tuning changes the parameters of the LLM completely to adapt to the new task. As a result, it would involve a complete update of the model architecture according to emerging requirements.\n",
        "The differences between fine-tuning and transfer learning also focus on the training process as a crucial parameter. Transfer learning involves training only a new top layer while maintaining other layers in a fixed state. The fine-tuning transfer learning debate frequently draws attention to the freezing of model parameters in transfer learning. Only in certain cases does the number of newly trained parameters account for only 1% to 2% of the weights of the original LLM.\n",
        "The training process of fine-tuning LLMs emphasizes the modification of specific layers and parameters for carrying out the new tasks. It involves updating the weights of any parameter according to the emerging utility of LLMs.\n",
        "Want to learn about ChatGPT and other AI use cases? Enroll now in the ChatGPT Fundamentals Course\n",
        "Another factor for comparing transfer learning with fine-tuning is the similarity between source task and the target task domain. Transfer learning is the ideal pick for scenarios when the new task domain is almost similar to the original or source task domain. It involves a small new dataset that utilizes the knowledge of the pre-trained model on larger datasets.\n",
        "Fine-tuning is considered more effective in scenarios where the new dataset is significantly large, as it helps the model learn specific features required for the new task. In addition, the new dataset must have a direct connection with the original dataset.\n",
        "The discussions about the transfer learning vs. fine-tuning comparison draw attention to the requirement of computing resources. Transfer learning involves limited use of computational resources as it is a resource-efficient approach. The working principle of transfer learning focuses on updating only a small portion of the LLM.\n",
        "It needs limited processing power and memory, thereby offering the assurance of faster training time. Therefore, transfer learning is the ideal recommendation for scenarios where you have to train LLMs with limited computational resources and faster experimentation.\n",
        "Fine-tuning works by updating all model parameters. As a result, it requires more computational resources and consumes more time. Fine-tuning utilizes more processing power and memory alongside increasing the training times, which increases for larger models. Full fine-tuning generally needs a large amount of GPU RAM, which piles up the costs for the process of training LLMs.\n",
        "Here’s is an comparison table on transfer learning vs fine tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Final Words\n",
        "The comparison between fine-tuning and transfer learning helps in uncovering the significance of the two training approaches. You have to find important highlights in the fine-tuning vs. transfer learning comparison, as they are crucial tools for optimizing LLMs. Transfer learning and fine-tuning can help in tailoring large language models to achieve specific tasks, albeit with crucial differences.

        "Blockchain technology has induced a major revolution in the conventional approaches to financial transactions and data storage. On the other hand, it has also gained attention for a prominent challenge in the form of blockchain trilemma. The definition of blockchain trilemma explained by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, reflects on the problems it causes.\n",
        "Most importantly, it embodies the necessity of a trade-off between the three distinct aspects of blockchain technology: decentralization, security, and scalability. Security is the collection of robust safeguards for blockchain networks. Scalability emphasizes the power of blockchain networks to accommodate more users and transactions without increasing transaction time and fees. The final element, decentralization, is a basic trait of blockchain and ensures equal distribution of power among all participants in the network.\n",
        "You might wonder about the importance of blockchain trilemma for developers and how the trade-offs can affect the future of blockchain technology. The interplay between the three elements plays out dangerously as enhancing one of them diminishes the effect of another aspect. Most developers believe that achieving the desired balance between the three elements simultaneously is extremely difficult. Let us learn more about blockchain trilemma and discover the potential solutions to resolve the setbacks due to blockchain trilemma.\n",
        "Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n",
        "Definition of the Blockchain Trilemma\n",
        "The blockchain trilemma serves as one of the major obstacles to adoption of blockchain and web3. The answers to “What is the blockchain trilemma?” reflect on the struggle to achieve optimal levels of scalability, security, and decentralization at the same time. Blockchain developers have to make compromises or trade-offs between the three elements to achieve desired results for their applications.\n",
        "The general assumption in the blockchain landscape suggests that public blockchains could only achieve two of the three elements simultaneously. Blockchain developers have to choose the elements they want to prioritize to achieve the desired goals of their applications. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the blockchain trilemma can help determine the unique value proposition for blockchain developers.\n",
        "Security\n",
        "The most important aspect of any blockchain network is the security it offers. Security is one of the cornerstones of blockchain trilemma and commands significant attention in the domain of blockchain. Any blockchain trilemma guide would emphasize the fact that a blockchain network must have the essential safeguards required for protection against malicious entities. It is a complex issue in blockchain networks, which are inherently decentralized and don’t have any central authority for supervising and protecting the system.\n",
        "You can refer to the example of Bitcoin blockchain to understand how security works in a blockchain network. The Bitcoin blockchain utilizes a combination of Proof of Work consensus mechanism and cryptography to ensure security. The consensus mechanism ensures interconnection of data blocks in a completely tamper-proof manner. Any type of modification in the data would be detected immediately by the network.\n",
        "On top of it, the system becomes more secure with the participation of more users or nodes in the network. With more participants in the network, it would become difficult for a single user or entity to gain control. Therefore, the blockchain network can ensure safeguards against potential threats such as 51% attacks.\n",
        "You can unravel the significance of blockchain trilemma explained for beginners with the example of Bitcoin blockchain. It showed how a secure blockchain network ensures immutability and resists attacks from malicious entities. However, security can be one of the major deterrents to decentralization as you would have to increase hash power in mining under Proof of Work consensus.\n",
        "For example, the Proof of Work consensus can increase the cost of mining alongside forcing the exit of smaller and less efficient mining setups. It can lead to centralization of miners, thereby leading to a trade-off with decentralization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability\n",
        "The next element in the blockchain trilemma is scalability. It is one of the prominent highlights in responses to “What is blockchain trilemma?” as it has become a major requirement for emerging blockchain solutions. Scalability is a major element that you have to emphasize in the development of blockchain networks. Scalability points to the ability of blockchain networks to manage continuously increasing volumes of transactions and the number of users without compromising transaction fees or speed.\n",
        "The web3 revolution has increased the demand for new blockchain projects. On top of it, every blockchain project wants to achieve global reach, thereby emphasizing the need to manage billions of users simultaneously. Scalability can be a major challenge for projects, especially when you want the other two elements of the trilemma in security and decentralization.\n",
        "Developers come across troubles in the process of improving security and decentralization when they have to focus on scalability. For example, the Bitcoin blockchain can process only seven transactions per second. It is significantly inferior to the performance of centralized payment systems such as Visa, which has the capability to manage 24,000 transactions per second.\n",
        "The stark contrast draws attention to the importance of blockchain trilemma and the inherent design of blockchain networks. For instance, the consensus mechanism in blockchain networks, such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, creates limitations. In the case of Proof of Work, you would have a secure but slow network. On the other hand, Proof of Stake requires processing of transactions by multiple participants, thereby slowing down the network.\n",
        "Scalability is an important requirement for blockchain technology to complete its promises and serve as a viable alternative to centralized platforms. The existing throughput of blockchain networks is a major concern for achieving scalability. You can refer to a blockchain trilemma guide to understand how scalability can lead to significant trade-offs.\n",
        "One of the proven methods to increase the processing speed and scalability of a network involves reducing the number of network validators responsible for verifying the transactions. However, such an approach stands against decentralization and reduces the trait of censorship resistance in blockchain.\n",
        "Developers can also lower the block time, which requires a reduction of the difficulty of the consensus protocol. In the example of Bitcoin blockchain, you would have to reduce the mining difficulty. For Ethereum blockchain, you have to lower the requirements for two-thirds consensus on the network. However, these trade-offs can lead to security problems.\n",
        "Learn about blockchain technology fundamentals, use cases, and enterprise blockchain platforms with this free Blockchain E-Book.\n",
        "Decentralization\n",
        "Decentralization is the most prominent trait of any blockchain network and differentiates it from conventional centralized systems. Discussions around queries like “What is blockchain trilemma?” focus on decentralization as it represents one of the core themes of blockchain and web3.\n",
        "Decentralized blockchain networks are known for even distribution of control among different participants, thereby removing the need for central authorities. The distribution of control plays a vital role in enhancing transparency and fairness in a blockchain network. On top of it, the distribution of control also ensures resistance of blockchain networks to external manipulation and censorship.\n",
        "It is also important to note that you cannot achieve decentralization without formidable challenges. For example, increasing the number of participants in a blockchain network improves decentralization in the network. On the other hand, it can lead to time-consuming processes to reach a consensus that can influence the scalability of the network.\n",
        "On top of it, highly decentralized networks could also have to compromise on security as malicious entities could join the network easily and launch attacks. Therefore, decentralization can turn into a major weakness of a blockchain network rather than serving as its strength.\n",
        "Check out the Blockchain Masterclass for a better understanding of the blockchain ecosystem and learn different use cases of blockchain in decentralized solutions.\n",
        "Impact of Blockchain Trilemma Trade-offs\n",
        "You can understand the importance of blockchain trilemma with better clarity by reflecting on examples of the impact of trilemma. For example, Bitcoin is a popular blockchain network that utilizes the Proof of Work consensus. It can offer a significantly unparalleled level of security. However, the design of Bitcoin blockchain creates difficulties for scalability. With the creation of Bitcoin Cash in 2017 through forking, the Bitcoin community aimed to increase the block size and solve the scalability issues.\n",
        "Bitcoin Cash turned out to be a successful initiative for increasing the transaction speed and lowering the transaction fees. On the contrary, Bitcoin Cash also led to another pitfall in the form of larger blocks, which require a complex mining process. Therefore, miners with advanced computing resources could only participate in Bitcoin mining, thereby sacrificing decentralization.\n",
        "Another prominent example of a blockchain trilemma guide draws attention to Ripple blockchain. It is a useful platform to ensure efficient and faster cross-border payments. On the other hand, the Ripple blockchain network is more centralized than other blockchain networks.\n",
        "Therefore, it is more vulnerable to censorship control. Ripple managed the scalability problem through adoption of a different consensus mechanism. As compared to Ethereum or Bitcoin, Ripple blockchain works with a limited number of validators for verifying and confirming transactions. Therefore, Ripple has to sacrifice decentralization to achieve security and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "What are the Solutions for Blockchain Trilemma?\n",
        "The most crucial aspect that you can find in an account of blockchain trilemma explained for beginners is the outline of solutions for the trilemma. General approaches to solving the blockchain trilemma involve implementation of changes at layer 1 or base layer or through tools on layer 2 or on top of the base layer. Here is an overview of the important solutions to blockchain trilemma in each category.\n",
        "The two most prominent layer 1 solutions to the blockchain trilemma include consensus protocol enhancements and sharding. One of the proven techniques to solve the blockchain trilemma revolves around changing the consensus mechanism of the network. The answers to “What is blockchain trilemma?” must also draw your attention towards the impact of changes in consensus mechanisms. For example, changing from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake consensus can remove dependence on miner nodes. Ethereum is one of the biggest examples of such transition, as it announced ‘The Merge’ in 2022.\n",
        "Sharding is also a viable layer 1 solution for addressing the blockchain trilemma problem. It is a type of horizontal partitioning or database management approach in which you can break data into shards or different pieces. You can store the shards in different locations, thereby freeing up more space for parallel transaction processing.\n",
        "The insights into importance of blockchain trilemma also point to the possibilities for using layer 2 solutions to resolve the trilemma. Some of the proven layer 2 solutions include nested blockchains, sidechains, and state channels. Each approach provides a distinctive solution to improve scalability alongside safeguarding security and decentralization on the main network.\n",
        "Start learning blockchain with world’s first Blockchain Career Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n",
        "Final Words\n",
        "The definition of blockchain trilemma revolves around the three elements of security, decentralization, and scalability. It is important to use a blockchain trilemma guide before approaching any blockchain or web3 development project. The three elements in blockchain trilemma can have a significant influence on the functionality of your project.\n",
        "For example, if you choose scalability for your app, then you might have to compromise the security of sensitive user information. On the other hand, democratization of control over the app can lead to scalability challenges.

        "Navigating the Different Cryptocurrency Regulations Worldwide\n",
        "The arrival of cryptocurrency regulations in the world is good news for businesses and governments worldwide. However, cryptocurrency regulations in the UK and the US are not the only points of attention in the crypto regulatory landscape. It is important to look at the regulations in other countries and the ways in which they serve unique implications. For example, some countries have introduced laws for the governance of cryptocurrency usage. On the other hand, others have included cryptocurrencies in existing AML regulations and taxation rules. On top of it, there are many countries working on modifications in the crypto regulatory frameworks. At the same time, they also experience struggles due to the intervention of multiple governments and financial regulatory authorities. Here is an overview of the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies across different jurisdictions.\n",
        "One of the important highlights in the review of cryptocurrency regulations by country draws attention to the United States. The US was the first destination of a retail Bitcoin transaction. However, cryptocurrency regulations are implemented in different ways, and they don’t have the status of a legal tender. At the same time, several state governments and the IRS attach some value to cryptocurrencies. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network attaches transmittable value to cryptocurrencies without considering them as legal tender. The IRS states that just like other income modes, Bitcoin is also subject to taxation. According to the taxation authority, cryptocurrencies are digital representations of value that work as a medium of exchange, store of value, or unit of account. It works by issuing tax guidelines for cryptocurrencies, albeit without considering them to be legal tender.\n",
        "Another important aspect of US cryptocurrency regulations draws attention to the legality of crypto exchanges. The good thing for cryptocurrencies is the legality of crypto exchanges across the United States. Crypto exchanges are subject to regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act. In the case of cryptocurrency regulations, the SEC assumes that cryptocurrencies are securities. Therefore, it can apply the laws used for the governance of securities to crypto exchanges and digital wallets. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network suggests that all digital wallets and crypto exchanges must share information about the issuer and beneficiary of all crypto transactions.\n",
        "The future of regulations in the US would revolve around combating cybercrime involving cryptocurrencies. It is important to note that the US has emerged as one of the most active enforcers of cryptocurrency regulations. As a matter of fact, the US is the only country that has actively implemented regulatory measures against big crypto companies.\n",
        "Enroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.\n",
        "The discussions about the answers to ‘which countries have regulated cryptocurrency’ also bring Europe to the limelight. It is important to note that the European Union is all set to implement the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation in 2024. The legislation aims to manage the complicated crypto industry. It was proposed in 2019 in response to the announcement of Diem, the crypto token of Meta. The legislation aimed to deal with money laundering, fraud, and concerns of illicit financing in the domain of cryptocurrencies. Another important aspect of the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation is its role in addressing perceived threats with stablecoins and CBDCs.\n",
        "Why would stablecoins present a threat? Private stablecoins from large companies such as Mastercard, Meta, and Visa could pose bigger threats. They have the potential to undermine sovereign currencies. One part of the EU’s regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies focuses on addressing threats by ensuring that issuers cannot mint stablecoins backed by currencies other than the Euro. In addition, the EU also presents another perspective on cryptocurrency regulations around the world as it plans to introduce a unified regulatory framework. As a matter of fact, the three major political institutions in the EU have approved the Markets in Crypto Assets or MiCA regulation. Although it has been enforced since June 2023, it would become fully functional only by December 2024.\n",
        "Embrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path.\n",
        "Another important addition among the countries which are the largest markets for cryptocurrencies is India. The scope of cryptocurrency regulations in India revolves around uncertainty, as there is no clear definition of regulations for cryptocurrencies. As a matter of fact, India exercised a warning for investors and advised them to stay away from crypto trading in 2013. At the time of writing this post, cryptocurrency was still not legal tender in India. On top of that, cryptocurrencies are not classified as a security or commodity.\n",
        "It is also important to note that India’s annual budget in 2022 imposed a tax of almost 30% on cryptocurrency transactions. The positive side of crypto regulations in India is that Bitcoin trading has gained legal status. On top of it, India also planned to introduce a digital currency that would offer a boost to the Indian economy. The digital currency based on blockchain can serve as an effective alternative to Bitcoin and could offer a more efficient and cheaper currency management system.\n",
        "The discussions about cryptocurrency legislation in India also draw attention to crypto exchanges. As you study more about cryptocurrency regulations by country, you can find that India exercises a strong restraint against crypto exchanges now. The Reserve Bank of India, or RBI, sent a notice to all banks in India in 2018, advising them against transactions with crypto exchanges. However, the Supreme Court overruled this decision in March 2020. It did not have any impact on the interest of investors as they had developed fear, and many investors sold their crypto assets in large numbers in November 2021.\n",
        "As the demand for crypto regulations gains momentum, the Indian government is actively making efforts to establish crypto regulations. The primary focus of the new guidelines revolves around the regulation of different crypto exchanges such as WazirX. With the new regulations, the Government of India aims to offer safer transactions to end users. In addition, the regulations also aim to address the concerns of illegal financing and money laundering with cryptocurrencies.\n",

        "While the European Union is one step ahead in terms of crypto regulations with MiCA, the United Kingdom is still working on developing new legislation. The review of cryptocurrency regulations in the UK has to show the world revolves primarily around ownership of cryptocurrencies and trading. While the Bank of England has declared that cryptocurrencies are not ‘real money,’ it has also stated that they don’t pose threats to the traditional banking ecosystem. On the other hand, the legal consequences and status of cryptocurrencies would change with time, according to their type, usage, and nature.\n",
        "The Bank of England and the FCA or Financial Conduct Authority have declared warnings alongside guidance on the use of cryptocurrency in the UK. As a matter of fact, the authorities banned retail cryptocurrency derivatives in December 2020 on the grounds of volatility risks. The UK is also a top addition among responses to ‘which countries have regulated cryptocurrency’ with a specific emphasis on taxation. The HM Revenue and Customs, or HMRC, has declared that the taxation of cryptocurrencies would be different as they could not be classified as traditional investments or financial assets. According to HMRC, the tax on cryptocurrencies would depend on parties involved in crypto transactions and their activities.\n",
        "The good news for crypto regulations in the UK is the legal validity of cryptocurrency exchanges. However, crypto exchanges must be registered with the FCA. All the crypto firms in the UK that operate in the UK and serve UK resident clients must have FCA registration. Any registered crypto service provider in the UK must abide by the rules for AML/CFT reporting and safeguards for customer assets against theft and deterioration of value. It is also important to note that the UK might have left the EU but has to abide by legislation for crypto in the EU, such as regulatory policies for AML and CFT. The UK Treasury announced in January 2021 that it would add certain crypto assets to the scope of financial promotions regulation.\n",

        },
        "Solana is one of the most popular blockchain networks right now, with a formidable potential for powering web3 solutions. It offers a highly scalable and interoperable blockchain network with the flexibility for creating advanced smart contracts suited to diverse use cases. The review of working mechanism of Solana draws attention to the Solana validator roles and responsibilities in the network.\n",
        "The role of validators in blockchain network revolves around verification of blockchain transactions and maintaining security of the ledger. Validators serve a crucial role in Proof of Stake blockchains by staking their assets and showing confidence in the potential of a blockchain network. Is the role of validators different in Solana? Let us learn more about the responsibilities of validators and how they work with the unique highlights of the Solana ecosystem.\n",
        "Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n",
        "What are Solana Validators?\n",
        "Solana validators are computers that help in running the Solana network. The first addition to Solana validator responsibilities is the execution of programs for tracking all accounts on the Solana cluster. Validators also ensure validation of transactions incorporated on the network, and any type of transaction on Solana is impossible without validators.\n",
        "As more independent entities participate in running validators, the cluster becomes less vulnerable to any disruption that could influence it. Validators serve a major role in growing the Solana network and get a first-hand impression of the workings of Solana cluster functions. In addition, Solana validators also become an important part of the community responsible for the growth of Solana ecosystem.\n",
        "What would Solana validators gain from their contributions to the Solana ecosystem? You can find the details of Solana validator rewards by uncovering the significance of staking. It is the process for active engagement of a user in validating transactions. Staking can be considered as the alternative to mining, albeit with consumption of limited resources.\n",
        "The working mechanism of staking involves locking the native asset of a blockchain network in a smart contract for maintenance of operations and security of the blockchain network. Validators ensure that a blockchain network has access to funds required for network maintenance and receive rewards for their contribution. In simple words, staking involves a contribution to security and maintenance of a blockchain network in return for rewards.\n",
        "Enroll now in the Solana Development Course to understand the workings of the Anchor framework, Solana Program Library, and Solana tokens.\n",
        "The Unique Validation Mechanism of Solana\n",
        "Another important highlight in the description of the working of Solana is the combination of Proof of Stake and Proof of History. You can find answers to ‘What Solana validators do?’ by exploring the details of the two mechanisms. Proof of Stake is one of the important terms in the blockchain landscape, as it offers an efficient approach to transaction validation on a blockchain network.\n",
        "It is a credible alternative to Proof of Work for verifying and adding new blocks to a blockchain network. Validators are an important component in Proof of Stake blockchains as they stake tokens in the network. The number of tokens that a validator stakes in a Proof of Stake blockchain would determine the chances of picking them up for validation.\n",
        "What is the Hype around Proof of History?\n",
        "Solana presents promising potential for empowering web3 solutions by using a unique take on consensus mechanisms. You can understand Solana validator roles and responsibilities more clearly by exploring the details of Proof of History. The Proof of History consensus mechanism involves implementation of a cryptographic clock on a trustless network for synchronization of nodes.\n",
        "Proof of History utilizes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm and creates a rhythmic clock that measures creation of blocks with the exact time when they were created. It accounts for the factor of delay in time required for predicting the outcome of an algorithm. With Proof of History, the blockchain network could make safe assumptions about time passing with every block.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the Importance of Proof of History?\n",
        "Proof of Work blockchain networks utilize massive amounts of energy as a measure of the effort for including transactions in a block. It is useful for ensuring that a blockchain network does not produce multiple new valid blocks. Most of the work in Proof of Work revolves around preventing the problems of double-spending. Proof of Work ensures physical constraints on software for providing security in hostile environments.\n",
        "The critical review of the roles of Solana validator would draw attention towards the slow speed of Proof of Work. Bitcoin uses Proof of Work and serves as an alternative to physical cash. However, modern global markets do not revolve around physical cash, and Proof of Work would have the same impact as transporting cash physically from one back to the other.\n",
        "In the new age of digital advancements, Proof of Stake also falls behind in terms of transaction speed. For example, DeFi transactions require faster processing alongside demanding effective arrangement of global events in a sequence facilitated by Proof of History. Validators in Proof of History must agree on the sequence of events in the past rather than using a single point of time to confirm transactions.\n",
        "In this case, blocks would not be measured in terms of memory space as they use periods, which implies that you can break down a span of time infinitely. The Proof of Stake in Solana blockchain only introduces a security layer for the network and provides rewards to honest participants alongside punishing malicious agents.\n",
        "Learn about blockchain technology fundamentals, use cases, enterprise blockchain platforms, BAAS vendors with Blockchain for Enterprise E-Book\n",
        "Working of Validators in Solana Ecosystem\n",
        "You can find more insights on Solana validator roles and responsibilities by exploring the working mechanisms of Solana validators. The primary role of validators revolves around management of the chaos in transactions that happen thousands of times per second. Validators offer a precise accounting of events through addition of data by using a hashing algorithm to prove the passage of time.\n",
        "The Solana validator ensures that a specific transaction has happened after and before specific points or hashes in time. Validators who monitor the transactions on Solana blockchain would have to pay a voting fee to confirm the transactions. Every participant on Solana blockchain would get the opportunity to submit a block and obtain the required rewards.\n",
        "It is important to decode the Solana validator responsibilities with a comprehensive explanation of the working of Solana validators. You must note that validators in Solana don’t generate and traditionally add blocks. The significance of block production is evident in the creation of a universal record of the passage of time.\n",
        "With the help of Proof of Stake rules, lead validators have to arrange the transactions they receive and add them to one of the hashes. On the other hand, observing validators must vote and validate the record of events. In Solana blockchain, more than 66% of validators must vote to ensure confirmation of a block.\n",
        "Start learning blockchain with world’s first Blockchain Skill Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n",
        "What Do You Need to Become a Solana Validator?\n",
        "Some of you might have doubts regarding the role of validators in Proof of History. It is important to note that Proof of History might be a revolutionary approach for organizing a blockchain. However, it is not an independent consensus mechanism like Proof of Stake. You can understand the roles of Solana validator as important components with the nature of Solana as a Proof of Stake network.\n",
        "On the other hand, Solana presents a major difference from other Proof of Stake blockchains, which do not have any official minimum limit for staking. However, validators must stake an adequate amount of SOL tokens for processing the voting fees, which is almost 1 SOL daily.\n",
        "The actual initial investment required to become a Solana validator is the required hardware. If you want to reap the Solana validator rewards, then you need a machine and stable network connection for managing all transactions on the Solana network. However, the initial investment in the machines would gradually become cheaper with the passage of time as hardware becomes more efficient and cost-effective.\n",
        "Problems of Congestion in Solana Network\n",
        "Solana has presented multiple complaints about network congestion in recent times. Bots capitalize on the cost-effectiveness of transactions on Solana and radical growth in popularity, thereby populating the network with unnecessary traffic. Using Solana network is similar to using Ethereum in the early days.\n",
        "The answers to “What Solana validators do?” would require an overview of how DeFi works. In the initial days of DeFi, Ethereum served as the top choice for creating new DeFi solutions and helped in revolutionizing the domain of financial services. However, the growing popularity of DeFi increased more transactions on Ethereum and led to the rise in ETH gas fees.\n",
        "It is important to note that DeFi strategies that need high-frequency trades, such as flash loans, selling NFTs, and arbitrage in volatile markets, are vulnerable. Solana has been tailored to manage all types of DeFi transactions. However, DeFi could encounter problems in situations when bots can duplicate transactions and send all of them at a time to one validator.\n",
        "The transactions are a part of one type of DDoS attack and work by flooding the network. Just like other blockchain networks, validators on Solana have been tailored for managing a fork for a short duration of time. Validators must carry out the fork until the network achieves consensus between validators on the actual blockchain. Congestion is one of the formidable problems of Solana networks, as it could crash validators or isolate them from infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Has Solana Experienced Network Congestion?\n",
        "Yes, Solana has experienced network congestion to such an extent that it had to experience a network halt. The network halt lasted for almost seven hours. In April 2022, Solana experienced a network halt lasting for seven hours. You can find another side of Solana validator responsibilities by understanding the impact of the biggest network halt on Solana. Validators struggled to keep up with almost 6 million transactions each second.\n",
        "The massive volume of transactions led to generation of traffic of more than 100 Gbps for individual nodes. As a result, validators crashed and blocked the voting process. The network halt itself is only a part of the problem. The aftereffects of the crash include validators struggling to restart and evaluate the chain of events to reach a consensus on where the network had been through disruption.\n",
        "What Does a Solana Validator Do?\n",
        "The importance of Solana validator roles and responsibilities is clearly visible in how they maintain and manage the network. Validators on Solana blockchain are responsible for running a node at all times. The Solana blockchain depends on effective validation of transactions. Therefore, validators must have optimal involvement in the network to ensure that all blocks can work effectively. Apart from maintenance of nodes, Solana validators must also participate in governance and community proposals.\n",
        "As a result, they play a crucial role in determining the course of Solana ecosystem development. Solana is the next generation of Proof of Stake networks, which permit on-chain governance. Therefore, validators must vote on the upgrades and parameters of the network. For example, validators voted on the proposal to enable inflation on the Solana mainnet beta in February 2021.\n",
        "What are the Rewards for Solana Validators?\n",
        "Solana’s dependence on validators provides a clear impression of how they manage the Solana network. What do validators receive in return for their effort? Entities that become validators would receive financial returns and rewards for their contributions to the Solana network. The distribution of Solana validator rewards involves distinct ways, such as staking rewards, commission on staking rewards, and transaction fees.\n",
        "When delegators earn rewards with the help of validators, the validators will receive a share of rewards. Validators could also earn rewards for their stakes invested in the network. Another notable way in which validators receive reward points at transaction fees. Validators receive a share of the transaction fees charged for every transaction on the Solana network.\n",
        "Start learning blockchain with world’s first Blockchain Career Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n",
        "Final Words\n",
        "Solana validators are an important part of the Solana ecosystem, as they help in building the core foundations of Solana. The review of Solana validator roles and responsibilities shows that they are important for managing transactions on Solana blockchain. They are also responsible for maintaining the network.\n",
        "Solana validators are also responsible for maintaining security and governance in the Solana network. As Solana blockchain gains prominence in the web3 landscape, it is important to reflect on its working mechanisms.

At the same time, it is also important to mitigate any potential harm emerging from the use of AI. Let us learn more about bias in AI systems and their variants, alongside the recommended methods for fighting against AI bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition of AI Bias\n",
        "The first highlight in answers to “What is AI Bias?” would point towards the capability of AI systems for transforming the use of technology. Until a few years ago, artificial intelligence was just a topic you would come across in science-fiction novels or films. However, the futuristic concept has turned into reality and has transformed different aspects of our daily lives. In addition, AI systems have also emerged as crucial tools for introducing major transformations in different industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, and retail industry.\n",
        "The benefits of AI systems should not overshadow the inherent risks associated with artificial intelligence. You should understand that an AI bias guide could help you identify how bias could affect the working of artificial intelligence. AI systems work by replicating the human thought process, and AI systems could also bring human biases in decision-making. The impact of AI bias is visible in different use cases, such as facial recognition, risk assessment, and chatbot interactions. Bias in AI systems could have a negative impact on businesses, individuals, and society.\n",
        "AI bias is also known as machine learning bias or algorithm bias. The bias in AI systems refers to a phenomenon in which the algorithm used in decision-making features systematic errors that are derived from preconceived stereotypes and notions. The review of AI bias examples would help you understand that AI bias is almost similar to human biases and leads to inaccuracy of decisions. AI biases emerge when AI algorithms draw narrow conclusions or use training datasets that do not offer an accurate representation of the concerned population.\n",
        "Take your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n",
        "Impact of AI Bias\n",
        "The next crucial factor you need to learn to prevent AI bias would be the impact of AI bias. You can notice the impact of AI bias in different ways, including subtle changes to large-scale errors or false assumptions. For instance, societal bias against women could lead to the development of AI systems that would favor male candidates over female candidates in making hiring decisions. On the other hand, cognitive bias against women with darker skin tones in the healthcare industry could lead to development of AI systems that would create diagnosis issues for women with darker skin tones.\n",
        "As a matter of fact, certain studies have reported that AI facial analysis techniques could have a higher misidentification rate in the cases of people with dark skin tones. A study by the Stanford University Human-Centered AI Institute showed that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training or CLIP model resulted in misclassification of people with dark skin tones.\n",
        "It serves as one of the earliest examples of AI bias, which shows the impact of racial bias in AI-based facial recognition systems. It is important to understand that such types of bias could be problematic in the era of increasing diversity and representation. For example, racial bias could have a negative impact on people from minority groups.\n",

        "What are the Popular Types of AI Bias?\n",
        "Bias in artificial intelligence could assume multiple forms and could be difficult to identify. You can find two broad categories of AI bias such as algorithmic bias and data bias, with unique implications. The first entry among the types of AI bias is algorithmic bias, which emerges when AI algorithms generate incorrect or unfair results due to the incorrect assumptions or underlying datasets used for training the algorithm.\n",
        "Algorithmic bias could arise in situations when the data used for training the algorithm features biases. For example, if a training dataset emphasizes a specific demographic group, it would not consider other populations. As a result, the AI algorithm would generate results that could reflect the biases in the training dataset. Therefore, it would change the balance of fairness in the algorithm.\n",
        "Another popular addition to an AI bias guide would point at data bias. It is a type of bias that emerges when training datasets for AI algorithms have biases or errors. Data bias could emerge from different sources, such as data cleaning process, data collection methods, and inherent biases associated with source data. For example, you can assume that a dataset for training AI systems to draw predictions for customer behavior could have an over-representation of specific ethnicities or genders. In the case of data bias, AI algorithms would lead to results that favor certain groups.\n",

        "How Does AI Bias Affect Different Industries?\n",
        "Artificial Intelligence has become a popular technology trend and influences different aspects of the lives of people. Therefore, AI technology should be unbiased and fair. The answers to “What is AI bias?” point to the real-world implications of biased AI, including unfair treatment of groups or individuals or generating inaccurate decisions or predictions.\n",
        "AI systems could be beneficial to society and introduce powerful changes. However, it is important to understand the pros and cons of AI for ensuring effective use of AI systems, especially with the different biases. Here is an outline of the different ways in which AI bias could affect different industries.\n",
        "Organizations in the education sector utilize AI for making decisions about admissions of students in schools, colleges, and universities. However, AI bias examples in the education sector could show that biased decision-making could lead to unfair exclusion of students. For instance, an AI algorithm could use a training dataset with biases for a specific race or gender. In such cases, the AI system could turn the results of the admission process in favor of the concerned groups.\n",
        "Have you ever wondered how you find the results on search engines? AI algorithms are responsible for determining the news articles that you would see on your screen. In such cases, AI algorithms could prioritize news articles that skew towards certain biases and result in biased news that does not represent the population.\n",
        "The best recommendation to prevent AI bias would point to the example of AI’s impact on financial services. Artificial intelligence has become an important component in transforming financial services, such as helping firms make decisions about credit ratings and loan approvals.\n",
        "When the algorithm used for decision-making in financial services has societal biases, it could lead to unwanted circumstances. For example, an AI algorithm for passing loan approvals could use a dataset featuring data from samples with white people. The AI algorithm could lead to unfair loan denials for people with darker skin tones.\n",
        "The different types of AI bias could also influence law enforcement, primarily due to biases in facial recognition technology. Biased AI in facial analysis technology could result in false positives that could lead to wrongful accusations and arrests. It is a particularly complicated problem for people of darker skin tones who are commonly implicated in arrests and are a major percentage of the prison population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Popular Instances of AI Bias\n",
        "The bias associated with AI systems has created multiple issues in the real world. It is important to learn about examples of AI bias and their implications for people and different industries. Here are some of the notable instances of the concerns emerging from AI bias.\n",
        "AI technology could help in reducing health inequalities, especially at a time when a country like the US has been experiencing problems with systematic racism. AI systems that have been trained on datasets that do not represent the actual state of healthcare could perform negatively for underrepresented populations.\n",
        "According to a 2019 study, researchers discovered that AI algorithms for predicting which patients need additional medical care could be influenced by bias. For example, the algorithms prioritized white patients over black patients. The AI algorithm emphasizes individual healthcare needs for determining healthcare expenses. However, the algorithm assumed that past healthcare expenditures could help in determining its effectiveness.\n",
        "Automation has been one of the key factors in the domain of ecommerce, and Amazon has leveraged automation for its own interests. Interestingly, the answers to “What is AI bias?” would draw attention to the experimental recruitment tool with AI functionalities. It was designed for assigning ratings to job applicants. However, the AI algorithm was biased towards women and called for changes in the algorithm.\n",
        "The computer models of Amazon have been working on analyzing resumes for almost a decade and could identify similarities in the candidate applications. Most of the applications were from males and reflected the male dominance in the industry. The AI algorithm learned that all applications should be from males, and thus, it penalized resumes from female applicants. Amazon made the programs to become completely neutral.\n",

        "The necessity to prevent AI bias has become an important highlight in the AI ecosystem. If you want to make the best of AI systems, then you must familiarize yourself with the following best practices to resolve AI bias.\n",
        "Real-world data might appear as a trusted and credible source of information for training AI models. At the same time, it is also important to verify that real-world data could include unintentional societal and human biases. You should not rely completely on real-world data for training datasets of AI algorithms. On the other hand, you should utilize a blend of real-world and synthetic data. It would ensure that the training dataset is completely accurate and unbiased.\n",
        "AI algorithms can be extremely complex, and it is difficult to identify biases without a comprehensive understanding of dataset and working mechanism of the algorithm. Any AI bias guide could help you understand that AI algorithms can be fair only if they are transparent. AI algorithms should provide a clear explanation of the decision-making process underlying their design. In addition, an organization should also offer an explanation of the mechanisms used for making decisions with responsible AI algorithms.\n",
        "The best approach for preventing bias visible in real-world examples of AI algorithms involves the use of human beings and computers in unison. For instance, if a machine cannot solve the issue, then humans should contribute to solving the problem. Therefore, the system would create a continuous feedback loop that would learn and improve continuously with every iteration. Subsequently, human-in-the-loop could help in ensuring accurate datasets that could lead to better precision and safety.\n",
        "Another notable approach for resolving different types of AI bias involves consistent testing of AI and ML models. Regular testing of AI and machine learning models ensures that AI algorithms can mitigate bias and ensure accuracy. Furthermore, you should also compare the results of the AI algorithm to the algorithms designed by humans. It can help ensure that the algorithm makes fair decisions.\n",

        "When it comes to Natural Language Processing, generative text is one of the most important use cases. Generative text involves making predictions of the words that will follow to form a sentence. In layman’s language generative text helps in predicting which word will be written after another word in a sentence. In the technology-driven era, you come across generative text almost everywhere, such as chatbots and word or sentence auto-corrections. Moreover, you may also come across them while performing grammar checks. Undoubtedly, today, generative text has become part and parcel of one’s daily life. Read on to find the answer to – What Is Syntactic Analysis NLP?\n",
        "Syntactic analysis basically refers to the process of examining natural language by applying the rules of formal grammar. By using grammatical rules for categories and groups of words, it is possible to allocate semantic structure to texts. However, you must bear in mind that grammar rules are not applicable to single words. In generative text, syntactic analysis helps in analyzing words to check for grammar and show the association. If you want to master Natural Language Processing, you must learn Syntactic Analysis NLP.\n",

        "Fundamentals of Syntactic Analysis\n",
        "When it comes to Natural Language Processing, syntax plays a cardinal role. This is because it serves as a roadmap for computer systems to comprehend as well as generate human language. Syntactic Analysis in NLP encompasses fragmenting sentences into their grammatical elements.\n",
        "For example, sentences may be broken down into their grammar components, such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives. Thus, it enables machines to understand the structure as well as the meaning of the texts. You can familiarize yourself with the basics of the concept with the help of the Syntactic Analysis NLP guide.\n",
        "The syntactic analysis, which is also known as parsing, is responsible for assigning a semantic structure to a given text. The assigning of a logical structure is possible by applying the rules of formal grammar in the context of natural language.\n",
        "You can refer to Syntactic Analysis NLP examples to improve your clarity on the subject. Here is a simple example for your understanding! The sentence ‘Class go to a girl’ fails to make any sense. It does not have any logical meaning. Moreover, the grammatical structure of the sentence is also not accurate. In this scenario, syntactic analysis will tell us that the particular sentence has no rational or logical meaning. Similarly, it can also tell whether the grammatical structure of a sentence is right or wrong.\n",
        "Excited to learn the fundamentals of AI applications in business? Enroll now in the AI For Business Course\n",
        "Purpose of Syntactic Analysis\n",
        "The fundamental purpose of syntactic analysis is to derive meaning from a text. In the analysis, checks are in place so that texts which are not meaningful or which do not make sense can be rejected. By analyzing a string of symbols by using formal grammar as the guide, Syntactic Analysis In NLP carries out its function.\n",
        "Syntactic analysis aids in understanding the structure relating to the input text. The analysis is done at an in-depth level starting from the basic symbols to all the way to an entire sentence. This technique enables it to determine whether a text has any logical meaning or not. The concept is of critical importance since it enables machines to understand human language. It plays an instrumental role in bridging the gap between humans and systems.\n",

        "Diverse types of Syntactic Structures\n",
        "Before diving further into the realm of Syntactic Analysis In NLP, you must understand different types of syntactic structures. Syntactic structures consist of a number of elements, such as phrases, clauses, constituency relations, and dependency relations.\n",
        "Phrases refer to a group of words that operate together as a single component within a sentence. Common terms encompass verb phrases as well as noun phrases.\n",
        "Clauses consist of a subject along with a predicate. Hence, clauses are larger or wider units that are used in language. Clauses may be independent, also known as main clauses, or dependent clauses, also known as subordinate clauses.\n",
        "Constituency grammar is responsible for breaking sentences into constituents like verb and noun phrases. The purpose of the breakdown is to capture the constituents that shed light on the syntax structure of sentences.\n",
        "In the case of dependency grammar, there exists a link between the words of sentences. The link is the dependency relation, which reveals how words in sentences depend on one another. The role of dependency relations is of high relevance in syntactic analysis. This is because they help in capturing the syntactic associations between words.\n",
        "Want to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in the Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course\n",
        "Key Syntactic Analysis Approaches\n",
        "The Syntactic Analysis In NLP makes use of diverse approaches for performing the dissection of grammar structure in language. You need to familiarize yourself with these approaches to strengthen your grip on syntactic analysis. The syntactic analysis approaches present a foundation for the comprehension of how words and phrases in sentences are linked with one another. Some of the chief syntactic analysis approaches include:\n",
        "Under this approach, context-free grammar is a conventional method. It acts as a useful method in the syntactic analysis domain. It involves a series of rules that capture how the combination of varying components of a sentence takes place. The context-free grammar rule assists in generating parse trees representing a sentence’s syntactic structure.\n",
        "Dependency grammar is another approach that focuses on the associations that exist between the words of sentences. A unique feature is that instead of creating hierarchical structures, it uses direct links. These links between words showcase which words rely on or depend on others in a sentence. This approach is useful in the case of languages that have a relatively free word order.\n",
        "Under the statistical approaches, Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) is a common method. PCFG basically uses context-free grammar. This is done by assigning probabilities to every production rule. The probabilities are responsible for reflecting the likelihood for a specific rule to be applicable in specific scenarios. This method is common when it comes to statistical parsing. It helps in finding a sentence’s syntax structure, which has the highest likelihood.\n",
        "Transition-based parsing is another method under the statistical approaches category. It involves the deployment of machine learning techniques for incrementally creating a parse tree. This is done by making decisions at each and every step. In this approach, the use of a series of activities is essential for constructing the ultimate parse tree. Transition-based parsing is highly effective and valuable when it comes to real-time applications.\n",
        "The common neural network-based approaches in syntactic analysis involve recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformer models. Each of these methods has different attributes that you must familiarize yourself with before knowing their application. The recurrent neural networks process sequences or series of words.\n",
        "Moreover, they maintain a hidden state which is responsible for capturing contextual information. A specific syntactic analysis task where RNN has high relevance is part-of-speech tagging. However, a key limitation of RNN is the sequential processing attribute, which limits its capabilities. Moreover, recurrent neural networks struggle when it comes to long-range dependencies.\n",
        "Convolutional neural networks are able to capture local patterns that may exist in the input. Due to this characteristic, CNN is suitable for the purpose of extracting syntactic associations between closely placed words. For performing dependency parching, the CNN method is applicable.\n",
        "The common transformer models that have been revolutionizing Natural Language Processing are GPT and BERT. You must already be familiar with these elements and how they are transforming the role of NLP for one and all. These models are capable of capturing local as well as global syntactic information. Due to their robust capabilities, they are seen as state-of-the-art tools of the current era. Some of the syntactic analysis tasks for which these models are ideal include dependency parsing and constituency parsing.\n",
        "Now that you have a better understanding of key syntactic analysis approaches, you know their relevance. However, you must keep in mind that each approach has its unique strengths as well as limitations. So, you need to make the choice of the approach wisely by taking into consideration the task and the capabilities of the approaches.\n",

        "Parsing Algorithms\n",
        "In syntactic analysis, the term parsing refers to the fundamental process of breaking down a sentence. By breaking the sentence into smaller fragments, it is possible to view their grammar components. Furthermore, it is possible to represent them in the form of a parse tree or a dependency graph. Over the years, a diverse range of parsing algorithms have come into existence for performing the specific task. In syntactic analysis, some of the common parsing algorithms are top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing, chart parsing, and shift-reduce parsing.\n",
        "Top-down parsing is also known as recursive descent parsing. It begins with the highest-level syntactic structure. Then, the structure is broken down into tinier constituents in a recursive manner. This parsing method initiates from the top-level grammar rule, and as it moves further, the lower-level rules are applicable. In case a rule is not applicable, then the parser retracts and considers different possibilities. The backtracking or retracting feature is the main limitation of top-down parsing.\n",
        "Just as the name suggests, bottom-up parsing is the opposite of the top-down parsing method. In bottom-up parsing, the parsing begins with single or individual words. The construction of the parse tree is possible through the bottom-up approach. In other words, the tress formation takes place by combining words in a successive manner to form more significant elements. A common example of the bottom-up parsing mechanism is shift-reducing parsing. In this method, progress is made by shifting words to a stack from the input. When the rule has been satisfied, they are reduced.\n",
        "Chart parsing is a dynamic method that is suitable for ambiguous or unclear grammar. It is capable of creating a chart data structure for storing and combining partial parse trees in an effective manner. In chart parsing, the application of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) or Earley parser algorithm is common for context-free grammars.\n",
        "One of the main highlights of chart phasing is that they are capable of handling ambiguity. Importantly, they are able to give a diverse range of parses for a single sentence. As a result, chart parsing is of immense value when it comes to natural languages which have complex syntax structures.\n",
        "The application of shift-reduce parsing is common in the case of dependency parsing with the objective of forming a dependency tree. A unique feature of shift-reduce parsing is that the parser maintains a series of actions along with a stack of words. The grammar rule serves as the ultimate guide on the basis of which the shifting of words takes place. It is a highly efficient method that is capable of handling non-projective syntax structures. Although other parsing may struggle to deal with them, the shift-reduce parsing algorithm may be able to effortlessly work with non-projective syntax structures.\n",
        "In the context of syntactic analysis, the relevance of parsing algorithms is high. These algorithms basically enable NLP to make sense of the structure of different sentences. Additionally, they also aid in extracting grammar information and recognizing relationships between words.\n",
        "Develop expert-level skills in prompt engineering with the Prompt Engineer Career Path\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "In NLP, the role of syntactic analysis is indispensable. It acts as the ultimate medium that helps to understand the logical meaning of sentences or certain parts of sentences. Without performing syntactic analysis, machines might fail to understand human language. The application of formal grammar rules in the Natural Language Processing context makes the analysis possible. In the Syntactic Analysis NLP guide, you have come across diverse concepts such as syntactic structures and syntactic analysis approaches. A solid and comprehensive understanding of syntactic analysis is instrumental in applying it effectively in the practical setting.\n",

        "Smart contracts are an essential component for ensuring decentralized and automatic execution of transactions on blockchain networks. It primarily deals with transactions involving financial assets. On the other hand, it is important to know that common smart contract vulnerabilities could lead to big losses. As a matter of fact, smart contract vulnerabilities have been responsible for financial losses measuring over $12.3 billion. For example, the DODO DEX lost almost $3.8 million in March 2022 to a smart contract vulnerability. In April 2023, one of the popular DeFi platforms, Yearn Finance, lost $10 million due to smart contract flaws.\n",
        "Smart contracts are responsible for transactions involving massive volumes of important data and assets, such as money transfers, service delivery, and access to protected content. As a result, they can be easy targets for hackers and other malicious actors. On the other hand, awareness of smart contract vulnerabilities could offer the opportunity to prepare for smart contract attacks. Let us learn more about some of the most common vulnerabilities of smart contracts and how you can resolve them.\n",
        "Excited to learn about the critical vulnerabilities and security risks in smart contract development, Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Security Course\n",
        "Popular Vulnerabilities for Smart Contracts and Mitigation Strategies\n",
        "Security is one of the foremost priorities in the process of designing and developing smart contracts. The different types of smart contract attacks in recent times and their magnitude imply that smart contract security is a mandatory requirement for new blockchain and web3 solutions. On top of that, you could not make any changes in the smart contracts once they have been deployed to blockchain networks with different vulnerabilities.\n",
        "Most important of all, the vulnerabilities of smart contracts are visible to everyone after they have been deployed on blockchain networks. Therefore, development teams and smart contract engineers must pay attention to the most important attack vectors for smart contracts. Here is an outline of the most common vulnerabilities in smart contracts and the strategies for mitigating them.\n",
        "Oracle Manipulation\n",
        "One of the prominent entries among vulnerabilities for smart contracts is Oracle manipulation. Smart contracts rely on oracles for accessing external data from sources outside the blockchain network. However, oracles can be responsible for smart contract security issues as malicious actors could manipulate oracles to achieve personal interests.\n",
        "Oracles help smart contracts interact with off-chain systems. On the other hand, manipulated or inaccurate Oracle data could enable automatic execution of smart contracts. Such types of issues are classified as Oracle issues for smart contracts. The Oracle issue has been responsible for exploitation of different DeFi applications.\n",
        "The most common example of such problems with smart contracts is visible in the flash loan attacks. Flash loans allow users to borrow any amount of cryptocurrency without any limit as long as they repay the loan in the same transaction. Attackers can use such loans to distort asset prices and generate profits without compromising the principles of blockchain technology.\n",
        "You can find solutions to the Oracle issue for smart contracts with decentralized oracles, such as Tellor or Chainlink. Another recommended mitigation strategy for such risks points to the use of multiple oracles. Decentralized oracles or multiple oracles for one smart contract ensure accuracy of input data for the oracle. Such types of oracles increase the difficulty and cost of manipulating oracle data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Denial of Service\n",
        "The most noticeable example of web2 attacks that have transitioned into the domain of web3 is denial of service. Smart contracts are also vulnerable to denial of service attacks. It is one of the common entries in a smart contract vulnerabilities list, which can create setbacks for users and reputation of web3 projects. The attack involves overloading a smart contract with services, such as authentication tasks.\n",
        "As a result, the attacker could prevent other contracts from execution and lead to unexpected reverts. For example, denial of service attacks can return unused gas and revert the state of the smart contract to the state prior to execution of the transaction. Subsequently, the attacker could find that the results of an auction or values in financial transactions can be manipulated easily.\n",
        "The promising approach to solving such types of smart contract attacks focuses on making the attacks costly. What are the proven ways to improve the cost of denial of service attacks for hackers? Higher gas fees and time-lock puzzles are some of the effective measures for increasing the costs of attackers. In addition, mitigation strategies for denial of service attacks also focus on making calls only to trusted contracts.\n",
        "Timestamp Dependence\n",
        "The collection of different types of vulnerabilities for smart contracts also includes timestamp dependence. It is important to note that the node executing the smart contract generates timestamp values. How does the timestamp lead to smart contract vulnerabilities, and what is their impact? The distributed nature of Ethereum creates difficulties in synchronization of time on every node. Since Ethereum is the preferred platform for developing and deploying smart contracts, it exacerbates the timestamp dependence issue.\n",
        "Malicious nodes could manipulate the timestamp value for designing a logic attack. The logic attack would target contracts that utilize the block timestamp variable for execution of time-critical operations. You can resolve such vulnerabilities by avoiding the use of block timestamp function for control or logic checks. It is also important to refrain from using block timestamp function as a source of randomness.\n",
        "Curious to understand the complete smart contract development lifecycle? Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Development Course\n",
        "Reentrancy Attacks\n",
        "Another common vulnerability in smart contracts is a reentrancy attack. The attack vector emerges from the imperative execution of Solidity smart contracts. Imperative execution implies that smart contracts must execute each line of code before the next line. It implies that the execution of the calling contract can be put on hold till the return of the call when the contract makes external calls to a different contract. Reentrancy attacks are one of the common additions to a smart contract vulnerabilities list, as the external contract could gain temporary control over the next sequence of events. As a result, reentrancy attacks lead to the creation of an infinite loop.\n",
        "Assume that a malicious contract attempts a recursive call to the original contract to withdraw resources without completion of the first call. As a result, the original contract would never have the opportunity to update the balance before completing the function. The smart contract security issues with reentrancy could take the form of multiple types of attacks. Some of the common types of reentrancy attacks include single-function, read-only, cross-function, and cross-contract reentrancy attacks.\n",
        "You can resolve problems with reentrancy attacks through careful design of external calls. It is important to note that such vulnerabilities arise from flaws in the code logic of smart contracts. Therefore, it is important to check and ensure updates on the state of the contract.\n",
        "In addition, you can also find another proven safeguard against reentrancy attacks with a reentrancy guard. Reentrancy guards could prevent the execution of multiple functions at one instance by locking the contract. You can rely on smart contract audit tools such as Mythril and Slither for checking the presence of different variants of reentrancy attacks.\n",
        "Want to know about the possible use cases of smart contract audits? Check out Smart Contract Audit Presentation now!\n",
        "Frontrunning Attacks\n",
        "Smart contracts are transparent, which implies that they are publicly visible on the blockchain network. Miners of a block could choose transactions with the highest gas fees. The priority fee is an effective tool for ensuring that you can have your transaction approved before other transactions.\n",
        "However, it also leads to problems with smart contracts as attackers could front-run the profitable contracts through submission of an identical contract, albeit with a higher gas fee. Generally, attackers implement frontrunning attacks through bots or even miners.\n",
        "You have to look for effective solutions to mitigate the risks of frontrunning attacks. One of the proven solutions for mitigating the risks of frontrunning involves accepting transactions that have the gas price below a specific threshold. You can also find a solution with a commit-and-reveal scheme in which users submit a solution hash first rather than a clear text solution. Malicious actors cannot view the solution before it is too late. At the same time, smart contract auditing tools can help in detecting frontrunning vulnerabilities.\n",
        "Integer Overflows and Underflows\n",
        "Arithmetic operations also play a role in creating vulnerabilities for smart contracts. Integer overflows and underflows are the most common smart contract vulnerabilities resulting from arithmetic operations surpassing the fixed range for the values. For the integer type uint8, the range of values spans from 0 to 255.\n",
        "If the values are higher than 255, then they would overflow, and the value would be reset to 0. On the other hand, values that are lower than 0 would be reset to 255. As a result, the state variables of the contract and the logic could go through unexpected modifications and could trigger invalid operations.\n",
        "The Solidity compiler, starting from version 0.8.0, would not allow code that could lead to integer overflows and underflows. It is also important to check the contracts that could be compiled with the earlier versions to support functions that involve a library or use arithmetic operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Information and Function Exposure\n",
        "Blockchain technology enables better accessibility for every individual. Sensitive and confidential information must be encrypted before they are saved to a blockchain network. However, transparency leads to different types of smart contract attacks due to visibility of functions and variables in smart contracts. As a result, the functions and variables would be open to abuse and misuse. You can find a solution to such issues with improvements in development workflow.\n",
        "Developers must ensure the implementation of proper access controls. In addition, developers must also implement the principle of least privilege with the help of variable and function visibility modifiers in Solidity. The modifiers help in assigning minimum visibility levels according to the desired requirements.\n",
        "Force-Feeding Attacks\n",
        "The next prominent cause for smart contract security issues points to the problems with force-feeding attacks. Developers could not prevent smart contracts from receiving the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, Ether. Malicious actors could utilize this vulnerability for force-feeding smart contracts with Ether.\n",
        "The attack revolves around the premise of manipulating the balance of Ether in the smart contract. The change in balance of Ether could lead to manipulation of function logic that depends only on desired balance for internal accounting. Some of the internal accounting processes include paying out rewards when the balance exceeds a specific level.\n",
        "The problem with such smart contract vulnerabilities is that it is difficult to stop the manipulation of smart contract balance. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the balance of the contract does not serve as a guard or check within a function. The actual balance of the Ether could be higher than the balance expected by the internal code of the contract.\n",
        "Gas Griefing\n",
        "Another prominent addition to the smart contract vulnerabilities list is gas griefing. Users should pay a gas fee for performing a transaction or executing smart contract on Ethereum blockchain. It serves as an incentive for the validators or miners to verify transactions. On the other hand, the price of gas depends on network capacity, supply, and demand at the time of transaction.\n",
        "Gas griefing happens when users send the gas fees required for executing the desired smart contract. However, they don’t send the fees required for executing subcalls or the calls made by the contract to other contracts. It would lead to a significant influence on the logic of the smart contract.\n",
        "The problem is that there is no proven technique for preventing gas griefing. Developers could find a solution by coding a contract for defining the amount of gas rather than the user. Such types of solutions are more likely to increase the chances of transaction failure.\n",
        "Start learning Smart Contracts and its development tools with world’s first Smart Contracts Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n",
        "Final Words\n",
        "The review of the different smart contract vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies shows that awareness could solve a lot of problems. You should understand the importance of smart contracts in managing valuable data and resources. Flaws in smart contracts could lead to security issues that impose the burden of financial losses.\n",
        "Therefore, smart contract developers must prepare an effective risk management strategy and smart contract audit plan for identifying vulnerabilities. Learn more about smart contract fundamentals to obtain a first-hand impression of the potential sources of vulnerabilities in smart contracts.\n",

        "Today, blockchain technology acts as one of the most promising concepts that has come into existence.\n",
        "It is basically a database mechanism that supports the transparent sharing of information via a business network. The emergence of the technology has made it possible to record as well as track transactions within a business network. The capabilities and properties of blockchain have significantly contributed to its rising popularity in the online community.\n",
        "Now, the main question that you may have in your mind is – What is the link between a Solana Smart Contract and blockchain? The answer to the question is simple. Solana is a blockchain that has a number of similarities with Ethereum. In order to understand the true potential of a Solana smart contract, you need to become familiar with Solana. The guide will help you broaden your knowledge of Solana and Solana Smart Contracts.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is Solana?\n",
        "Solana is a blockchain platform, and its ultimate purpose involves the hosting of decentralized applications. The platform makes use of a ‘proof of history’ (PoH) along with a ‘proof of stake’ (PoS) consensus mechanism. The PoH mechanism allows the timestamping of transactions and supports efficient verification. On the other hand, the PoS mechanism allows validators to validate transactions.\n",
        "Solana is capable of processing a large number of transactions per second in comparison to its rival, Ethereum. The fact that it charges much lower fees than its rival makes it immensely popular and in demand in the blockchain community. One of the main highlights of Solana is that its algorithms help in removing performance obstacles relating to blockchain software. This property makes it highly secure, scalable, and decentralized. Now that you are familiar with Solana blockchain, it is time to dive deeper and learn about Solana smart contracts.\n",
        "Curious to understand the complete smart contract development lifecycle? Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Development Course\n",
        "What are Solana smart contracts?\n",
        "A Solana smart contract refers to a contract that is run on the Solana network. In case your question is not yet answered, you need to look at Solana and smart contracts separately. As already highlighted, Solana is a blockchain platform. A smart contract is a program that is stored on a blockchain network. These programs are capable of executing predefined actions. The execution can take place as soon as the necessary predefined conditions have been met.\n",
        "Smart contracts are of immense value since they help in the automation of agreements between two or more participants. In smart contracts, codes play a key role as they mediate such contracts. As a result, participants do not have to worry about the involvement of any third parties or intermediaries. Moreover, they do not have to worry about incurring unnecessary losses. Solana smart contracts have gained massive popularity as they combine the benefits of the Solana blockchain and the smart contract concept.\n",
        "Excited to learn about the fundamentals of Solana and Solana smart contracts development, Enroll now in the Solana Development Course.\n",
        "The architecture of Solana Smart Contract\n",
        "In order to create Solana smart contract, you need to first get familiar with the architecture of Solana Smart Contract. You must note that the smart contract model in Solana is different from the conventional Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enabled blockchain. The traditional model fuses logic or code as well as state into one contract whose deployment takes place on-chain. On the other hand, Solana’s smart contract exists in a stateless or read-only mode. Moreover, it only contains the program logic component.\n",
        "After the deployment of a Solana smart contract, its accessibility is possible through external accounts. These external accounts are responsible for interacting with the program for the purpose of storing program interaction-specific data. As a result, there is a distinction between the state and the contact logic. Besides, you must note that the Solana blockchain stores data in the form of wallet information, unlike Ethereum.\n",
        "Solana comes with a command line interface, also known as CLI and JSON RPC application programming interface. These elements play a chief role in enhancing the decentralized application’s (DApp) interaction with Solana. In addition, the DApp can utilize the existing software development kit to interact with the programs on the Solana blockchain.\n",

        "Key elements for creating Solana Smart Contracts\n",
        "The program, which represents the first development workflow, is fundamental to build Solana Smart Contract. It enables users to create as well as deploy custom Rust, C + +, and C programs on the Solana blockchain. After the deployment of these programs, anyone with a solid knowledge of programming can use them.\n",
        "If you have solid programming skills, you can definitely use them. To communicate with the programs, you must write DApp. It can be done by using any software development kit client at hand. Then, you can use the JSON RPC application programming interface for internal workings.\n",
        "The second development workflow involves the client, where users can write DApp. DApp can be used for the purpose of communication with the deployed programs. These apps are responsible for the submission of transactions to the programs through the software development kit client. Furthermore, it can create a diverse range of applications, such as decentralized exchanges, client wallets, etc.\n",
        "Both the first and the second development workflow, i.e., program and client, function cohesively. By working together, they are able to form a comprehensive network of DApps as well as programs. It facilitates the interaction for updating the state and examining the blockchain.\n",

        "Building Solana Smart Contracts\n",
        "In order to build Solana smart contracts, you need to adopt a systematic approach. You do not need to rush to learn the process, as it may confuse you. However, by following the simple step-by-step guidance you can broaden your insight into Solana smart contract language and become a pro when it comes to building smart contracts.\n",
        "Before building Solana smart contracts, the first thing that you must do involves setting up a Solana environment. In the section, the Solana smart contract example that is presented is Hello World. It is a Rust program that can write its output to the console.\n",
        "For some people, the direct running of a smart contract code from Windows may get confusing or overwhelming. If you also do not feel comfortable, you need not have to worry. An easier option is to set up the Ubuntu version of the window subsystem of the Linux operating system. By taking this step, you will be able to write the code in the Windows OS, and later, you can put together the Rust smart contract into a .so file. You need to give the necessary commands for setting up the ideal environment for the Solana smart contract deployment. Then, you need to run the Hello World app for testing purposes.\n",
        "In this step, you have to use the Rust programming language to create Solana smart contracts. Some of the requisites that are needed for the process include Solana CLI v1.7.11 or the later version, the latest stable Rust build, NodJS version 14 or higher, and Git. These installations are fundamental for proceeding in your journey of building Solana smart contracts.\n",
        "Since the example that is given involves Hello World, you need to broaden your insight into it. Hello World is a smart contract or software that can log in to the console. In addition, it can count the total number of times the Hello World application is used for a specific account. Besides, it can store the exact number on-chain. To help you grasp the concept better, the explanation is given in a simple and comprehensible manner.\n",
        "You need to use standard Solana programming parameters. It will help you to establish the very starting point of the program. In addition to this function, the specific portion helps serialize as well as deserialize arguments, passing them to and from the deployed application. This is possible with the help of BORSH or Binary Object Representation Serializer for Hashing. You need to give the appropriate command for the configuration of the HelloWorld Software.\n",
        "After the completion of the process, the starting point, i.e., the process instruction function, will receive the program ID. The program ID is basically a public key that contains the specific location of the program’s deployment. Moreover, it contains the accounting parameter. This parameter is responsible for specifying the account to which the program must say hello.\n",
        "The core logic of the program lies in the ‘Programresult’ class. It is responsible for generating a notice in such a situation. Moreover, it also chooses the appropriate account from the ‘accounts.’ In the specific example, a single account will be used. Subsequently, the application can assess whether it has the authority to edit data that is related to the particular account. In the end, the code is able to retrieve the number that is stored for the existing account. It also increases it by one unit and then writes the result, after which a message is displayed.\n",

        "Deployment of Solana Smart Contracts\n",
        "Now that you know how to build a Solana smart contract, you may be asking yourself – How do I deploy a smart contract on Solana? The answer is fairly simple. The initial step for initiating the deployment of the contract involves the cloning of the repository. After all the processes have come to an end, you can alter the environment to Devnet. Devnet is the test net that Solana developers can use to test their smart contract skills. You need to see for yourself how capable you are when it comes to building Solana smart contracts.\n",
        "After testing your skills, you need to produce a new key pair. It will basically enable the engagement of the account with the smart contracts and deployed applications in Solana Devnet. However, you need to bear in mind that this approach may not be entirely safe for crucial storage. Moreover, it is ideal only for the purpose of demonstration. Hence, for passing security, you will be elevated.\n",
        "Once the creation of the account takes place, you can participate in airdrop and get your hands on the requisite SQL tokens. In addition, you will need certain imports to facilitate the implementation of the smart contract. To get the SQL tokens in the new account, you must use the suitable command. Now, you are ready to create the Hello World program with the help of the necessary command.\n",
        "After its creation, you need to deploy it on Devnet. With the outcome of the previous command, you acquire the command for launching the program. It brings the deploying process to an end. You need to allocate a programming ID to the application. You can authenticate the software on the Solana Devnet Explorer.\n",
